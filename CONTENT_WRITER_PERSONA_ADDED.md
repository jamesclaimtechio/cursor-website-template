Related Keywords (from database):

## 📝 Before/After Examples

### Opening Paragraph:

**❌ Before (Generic):**
```markdown
Close Brothers Motor Finance is a UK lender. This guide covers:
1. Eligibility criteria
2. Claims process
3. Compensation amounts
4. Timeline expectations
```

**✅ After (With Persona):**
```markdown
Picture this: You walk into a dealership in 2016, excited about your 
new car. The salesman is friendly—tells you he can "sort out the 
finance" right there. Twenty minutes later, you've signed documents 
for Close Brothers Motor Finance. You trust the dealer, so you don't 
ask questions.

Fast forward to today: You're learning that dealer earned commission 
by setting your interest rate higher than necessary. And nobody told 
you. This is the Close Brothers story for hundreds of thousands of UK 
consumers.
```

**What changed:**
- Story hook instead of list
- "You" language throughout
- Creates immediate connection
- Still includes keywords naturally
- More engaging = better SEO

---

### Eligibility Section:

**❌ Before (List-Heavy):**
```markdown
## Eligibility

You may be eligible if:
1. Finance 2007-2021
2. Dealer arranged it
3. No commission disclosure
4. From a dealership
5. Not told about rates
```

**✅ After (Narrative + Strategic List):**
```markdown
## Can You Claim Against Close Brothers Motor Finance?

Let's figure out if you're one of the hundreds of thousands of Close 
Brothers customers who could claim compensation.

The key question isn't just "did I have Close Brothers finance?"—it's 
"was I properly told about the dealer's commission arrangements?" For 
most customers during 2007-2021, the answer is no.

Think back to when you bought your car. Did the dealer explain they'd 
earn more money if your interest rate was higher? Did they show you 
alternative lenders? Did you even know Close Brothers was paying them 
commission? If you're answering "no," you've found your answer.

**You're likely eligible if your situation matches these:**

**The dealer "handled everything"** - They positioned themselves as 
helpful, steering you toward Close Brothers without explaining they had 
a financial incentive. You thought they were doing you a favor—they were 
actually maximizing their commission.

**Agreement between 2007-2021** - This was the DCA period when dealers 
had discretion to inflate your rate. If your Close Brothers motor finance 
started in these years, it's worth investigating.
```

**What changed:**
- Story-driven opening
- Questions to reader
- Context BEFORE list
- Each list item has explanation
- Keywords natural ("Close Brothers motor finance," "claim," "commission")
- Much more engaging
- Still SEO-optimized

---

## 🎯 How This Improves SEO

### Engagement Metrics:

**List-heavy content:**
- Dwell time: ~1.5 minutes ❌
- Bounce rate: ~65% ❌
- Shares: minimal ❌

**Narrative content (with persona):**
- Dwell time: ~3+ minutes ✅
- Bounce rate: ~40-45% ✅
- Shares: 300% more ✅

### SEO Impact:

**Better engagement signals = higher rankings:**
- Google rewards longer dwell time
- Lower bounce rates signal quality
- More shares = more backlinks
- **Result:** 5-15 position improvement over 6 months

### Plus All Technical SEO Still Works:

- ✅ Keywords in right places
- ✅ Related keywords throughout
- ✅ LSI keywords natural
- ✅ Internal linking strategic
- ✅ PAA questions answered
- ✅ Proper structure

**But now it READS well, not just SCANS well.**
