# Content Stat Box Guidelines

**Issue identified:** December 18, 2025  
**Posts affected:** 3 (mis-sold car finance, PCP claims, Close Brothers)  
**Root cause:** Mixed SEO research data with user-facing content  

---

## ❌ NEVER Show Users (Internal SEO Data)

**These are for keyword research ONLY, not for content:**

### Search Volume Data
- ❌ "50,000+ monthly searches"
- ❌ "1,900+ people searching for this"
- ❌ "Monthly searches for X"
- ❌ "Search volume for X"

**Why it's wrong:** Users don't care how many people search. They care about their own problem.

### Trend Data
- ❌ "+900% growth in searches"
- ❌ "Trending keyword"
- ❌ "Search interest increased"
- ❌ "Popular search term"

**Why it's wrong:** Search trends are meta-information. Users want solutions, not SEO metrics.

### Competition Data
- ❌ "High competition keyword"
- ❌ "Featured snippet opportunity"
- ❌ "Top 10 ranking"

**Why it's wrong:** This is for us (SEO), not for them (users).

---

## ✅ ALWAYS Show Users (Real-World Impact)

**These matter to people reading your content:**

### Scale of Issue
- ✅ "Up to 14 Million UK consumers potentially affected"
- ✅ "Millions of people with PCP between 2007-2021"
- ✅ "Hundreds of thousands financed by [Lender]"

**Why it works:** Shows they're not alone. Validates their concern is real and widespread.

### Financial Impact
- ✅ "£11 Billion estimated industry cost"
- ✅ "Average payout: £700 per agreement" (industry-wide)
- ✅ "£[X] recovered for consumers"

**Why it works:** Helps them understand the scale and potential compensation.

### Timeline Information
- ✅ "Affected agreements: 2007-2021"
- ✅ "FCA redress scheme: May 2026"
- ✅ "Average claim time: 3-4 months"

**Why it works:** Sets expectations. Helps them understand where they fit.

### Success Metrics (If You Have Data)
- ✅ "X claims processed successfully"
- ✅ "X% success rate" (only if verified)
- ✅ "X satisfied customers"

**Why it works:** Builds trust. Shows social proof.

## 🧠 How to Think About Stat Boxes

### Ask Yourself:

**Bad question:** "What's interesting about our keyword research?"  
**Good question:** "What does the reader need to know to understand their situation?"

**Bad question:** "How can we show this keyword is trending?"  
**Good question:** "How many people are affected by this issue?"

**Bad question:** "What search volume should we highlight?"  
**Good question:** "What validates this is a real, widespread problem?"

### The User Perspective Test:

Before adding a stat, imagine you're the reader and ask:
- "Does this help me understand if I'm affected?"
- "Does this help me understand the scale of the issue?"
- "Does this help me decide whether to take action?"
- "Does this make me trust the information more?"

If the answer is NO to all four → Don't use it!

## 📝 Fixed Examples

### Before (Wrong):

```
:::stat
value: +900%
label: Growth in mis-sold car finance searches (trending now)
:::
```

**Problem:** User thinks: "Why do I care about search growth? I want to know if I'm affected!"

### After (Right):

```
:::stat
value: Up to 14 Million
label: UK consumers potentially affected by car finance mis-selling
:::
```

**Better because:** User thinks: "Wow, 14 million people! This is real. I might be one of them."

---

### Before (Wrong):

```
:::stat
value: 50,000+
label: Monthly searches for PCP claims information
:::
```

**Problem:** "So what if 50k people search? Am I eligible or not?"

### After (Right):

```
:::stat
value: Millions
label: UK consumers with PCP agreements between 2007-2021
:::
```

**Better because:** "Millions had PCP during that time. I had PCP in 2015. This applies to me!"

---

### Before (Wrong):

```
:::stat
value: 1,900+
label: Monthly searches for Close Brothers motor finance claims
:::
```

**Problem:** "Is 1,900 a lot? Should I care?"

### After (Right):

```
:::stat
value: Hundreds of Thousands
label: Vehicles financed by Close Brothers during DCA period
:::
```

**Better because:** "Hundreds of thousands of people used Close Brothers. My claim is legitimate."

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Mixing Research with Content

**Wrong thinking:** "This keyword is trending +900%! Let's tell users!"  
**Right thinking:** "Users don't care about trends. What's the real-world impact?"

### 2. Excitement About SEO Wins

**Wrong thinking:** "We're targeting 50K monthly searches! That's huge!"  
**Right thinking:** "50K people searching means millions are affected. Show that."

### 3. Showing Your Work

**Wrong thinking:** "Let's show we did keyword research"  
**Right thinking:** "Let's show users this is a real, validated issue"

### 4. Internal Metrics as External Value

**Wrong thinking:** "High search volume proves this is important"  
**Right thinking:** "Scale of affected consumers proves this is important"

## ✅ Quick Checklist Before Publishing

Before any stat box goes live, check:

- [ ] Does this show SEO research? (search volume, trends, competition) → REMOVE
- [ ] Does this show real-world impact? (people affected, money involved) → KEEP
- [ ] Would I care about this if I was the reader? → KEEP only if YES
- [ ] Is this from Motor Finance Redress doc or verified source? → KEEP if sourced
- [ ] Is this just "interesting" to SEO nerds? → REMOVE

## 📚 Where Stats Should Come From

### Approved Sources:

1. **Motor Finance Redress doc**
   - 14 million consumers affected

   - ~£700 average payout

2. **FCA Official Data**
   - Redress scheme timeline
   - Regulatory actions
   - Market size data

3. **Supreme Court Rulings**
   - Case outcomes
   - Legal precedents
   - Named lenders

4. **Your Own Data (When Available)**

### Never From:

## 🔄 How This Mistake Happened

### Root Cause Analysis:

**Step 1:** Researched keywords  
- Found "mis sold car finance" trending +900%  
- Found "pcp claims" with 50K searches/month  
- Got excited about the opportunity  

**Step 2:** Created content  
- Was still in "keyword research mode"  
- Wanted to show the keyword was validated  
- Mixed research data with content  

**Step 3:** Didn't switch perspectives  
- Kept thinking like an SEO  
- Didn't ask "what does the reader care about?"  
- Published without the user perspective check  

### Lesson Learned:

**Clear mental separation needed:**

**Research Phase:** Use all SEO data  
↓  
**Writing Phase:** Switch to user perspective  
↓  
**Review Phase:** Remove any SEO research leaking through  

---

## 💡 Prevention Strategy

### 1. Separate Research from Content

**Keep in separate docs:**
- Keyword research → `docs/seo/` folder
- Content briefs → Reference data, don't copy it
- Blog posts → Only user-relevant stats

### 2. User Perspective Checklist

Before publishing, read through and ask:
- "Do I sound like I'm talking to an SEO colleague?"
- "Am I showing my research process?"
- "Would my mum/friend understand and care?"

### 3. Stat Box Review Process

Every stat box must pass:
1. **Source check:** From approved source? ✓
2. **Relevance check:** User cares? ✓
3. **Compliance check:** Can we claim this? ✓
4. **No-SEO check:** Not research data? ✓

---

## 🎯 Summary

### Remember:

**Your reader is:**
- Someone who had car finance
- Wondering if they're affected
- Wants to understand their situation
- Needs to decide whether to claim

**Your reader is NOT:**
- An SEO specialist
- Interested in keyword trends
- Cares about search volume
- Wants to see your research

**Always show them what matters to THEM, not what matters to YOU.**
