### 2. Stories Before Lists
✅ Start with scenario, THEN list key points  
❌ Jump straight to bullet points

### 3. Explain WHY, Not Just WHAT
✅ "Commission rates matter because that 2% compounds to £800..."  
❌ "Commission rates affect compensation."

### 4. Keywords Hidden in Narrative
✅ Natural mentions within engaging stories  
❌ Forced repetition in lists

### 5. Trust Through Transparency
✅ "Average £700, but yours may differ..."  
❌ "You'll get £700 compensation!"

## 🎯 Keyword Integration (Technical SEO)

### Primary Keyword Must Appear In:
1. ✅ Title tag (first 8 words ideal)
2. ✅ H1 heading (exact match)
3. ✅ First paragraph (within 50 words)
4. ✅ 2-3 H2 headings (variations okay)
5. ✅ Meta description
6. ✅ Conclusion paragraph

**Density:** 1-2% (5-10 times in 1,500 words)

### Related Keywords (From Database):
- Read `relatedKeywords` array from keyword database
- Use 3-5 times each naturally
- In: subheadings, examples, explanations
- Never forced, always conversational

### LSI Keywords (Always Include):
**For car finance content:**
- Commission, dealer, lender, agreement
- PCP, HP, finance type
- Interest rate, APR
- FCA, Supreme Court
- Compensation, refund, eligibility

**Use naturally throughout content**

---

## 🔗 Internal Linking (Every Post)

### Link Strategy:
- **3-5 internal links** per post
- **Link to:** Pillar pages, related cluster content, service pages
- **Anchor text:** Keyword-rich and descriptive
- **Placement:** Early (para 2-3), mid-content, conclusion

### Good Anchor Text:
✅ "complete guide to car finance claims"
✅ "understanding DCAs in car finance"
✅ "FCA redress scheme launching May 2026"

### Bad Anchor Text:
❌ "click here"
❌ "read more"
❌ "this article"

### Contextual Linking:
Always explain WHAT the link leads to:

✅ **Good:**
"The dealer's ability to inflate your rate came from [how DCAs worked 
in car finance](/understanding-dcas) during 2007-2021."

❌ **Bad:**
"Learn more about DCAs [here](/understanding-dcas)."

## 💬 Voice & Tone Quick Reference

### Voice:
- Professional but conversational
- Expert but accessible
- Confident but humble
- Clear but not simplistic

### Language Patterns:

**USE:**
- "You" and "your" (90%)
- "Let's" (inclusive, occasional)
- "Think back to..." (engaging)
- "Here's what actually happened..." (clear)
- "Sound familiar?" (rhetorical questions)
- Contractions ("you're," "don't," "it's")

**AVOID:**
- "Consumers" or "customers"
- "One might" (too formal)
- "Claimants" (too legal)
- Corporate jargon
- Third person

## 🎨 Writing Techniques

### 1. The Story Hook
Start sections with relatable scenarios:

"Picture this: You walk into a dealership in 2016, excited about your 
new car. The salesman says 'I'll sort the finance.' Twenty minutes 
later, you've signed..."

### 2. The Question Hook
Engage with direct questions:

"Ever wondered why your interest rate seemed so high? Here's what they 
didn't tell you..."

### 3. The Empathy Bridge
Show understanding:

"Sound familiar? This is exactly what happened to hundreds of thousands 
of Close Brothers customers..."

### 4. The Plain English Explanation
Simplify complex terms:

"Think of DCAs like this: Imagine a salesperson who gets bigger 
commission by overcharging you—except it was hidden in your finance rate."

### 5. The Real Example
Use concrete numbers:

"On an £18,000 loan over 4 years, that 2% difference compounds to 
roughly £800 in overpayments."
