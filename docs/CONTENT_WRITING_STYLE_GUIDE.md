# Content Writing Style Guide

**Issue identified:** December 18, 2025  
**Problem:** List-heavy content that's hard to read and performs poorly on SEO  
**Solution:** Conversational, narrative-driven content with strategic lists  

---

## 🎯 The Golden Rule

**Write like you're explaining to a friend over coffee, not reading from a checklist.**

---

## ❌ What NOT to Do

### 1. List After List After List

**Bad example:**

```markdown
## Eligibility Criteria

You may be eligible if:
1. You had finance 2007-2021
2. Dealer arranged it
3. Commission not disclosed
4. From a dealership
5. Interest rate was high

## Signs of Mis-Selling

Look for these signs:
1. Felt pressured
2. No explanation
3. High rates
4. Rushed process
5. Missing information

## What to Check

Check these things:
1. Your paperwork
2. Interest rate
3. Dealer name
4. Lender name
5. Commission disclosure
```

**Why this is bad:**
- No breathing room
- Feels robotic
- No context or explanation
- Readers scan and bounce
- Poor engagement signals
- Low time on page
- Doesn't demonstrate expertise

---

### 2. Every Point as a Bullet

**Bad example:**

```markdown
Close Brothers offers:
- PCP finance
- HP finance  
- Lease purchase
- Personal loans

PCP features:
- Lower monthly payments
- Balloon payment at end
- Option to return car
- Popular choice

HP features:
- Own car at end
- Higher monthly payments
- No balloon payment
- Simpler structure
```

**Why this is bad:**
- No flow between points
- Each bullet is disconnected
- Reads like a spec sheet
- No personality or authority

---

### 3. Template-Style Writing

**Bad example:**

```markdown
## How to Claim

Step 1: Gather information
Step 2: Submit claim
Step 3: Wait for response
Step 4: Receive compensation

## Timeline

Week 1-2: Information gathering
Week 3-10: Lender assessment  
Week 11-14: Negotiation
Week 15-18: Settlement
```

**Why this is bad:**
- Feels automated
- Could be for ANY lender/topic
- No specific insights
- Doesn't show expertise

---

## ✅ What TO Do

### 1. Start with Story or Scenario

**Good example:**

```markdown
## Understanding Close Brothers Motor Finance

Picture this: You walk into a dealership in 2016, excited about your new car. The salesman is friendly, helpful—tells you he can "sort out the finance" right there. Twenty minutes later, you've signed documents for something called "Close Brothers Motor Finance." You trust the dealer, so you don't ask questions.

Fast forward to today: You're learning that dealer earned a commission by setting your interest rate higher than necessary. And nobody told you.

This is the Close Brothers story for hundreds of thousands of UK consumers. Let's break down what happened and why you might be entitled to compensation.
```

**Why this works:**
- Creates immediate connection
- Tells a relatable story
- Sets context before diving into details
- Keeps readers engaged
- Demonstrates understanding of customer experience

---

### 2. Use Lists Strategically (Not Everywhere)

**When to use lists:**
- ✅ Quick reference points (3-5 items)
- ✅ After you've explained the context
- ✅ For key takeaways or action items
- ✅ In FAQ sections
- ✅ For comparison tables

**When NOT to use lists:**
- ❌ For every single section
- ❌ As your primary content format
- ❌ Instead of explanation
- ❌ Back-to-back without narrative

**Good example of strategic list:**

```markdown
## Signs Your Close Brothers Finance Was Mis-Sold

The hidden commission scandal affected thousands of Close Brothers customers, but many people don't realize they were impacted. The signs aren't always obvious—after all, dealers were trained to make these arrangements seem normal.

Let's walk through what Sarah discovered when she reviewed her 2017 Close Brothers agreement. She'd always wondered why her interest rate was 10.9% when her friend got 7.5% from a bank for similar credit. Turns out, the dealer had discretion to set rates between 7% and 12%—and chose the higher end to maximize commission.

**Here's what to look for in your own agreement:**

**"We'll sort the finance"** - If your dealer arranged everything without you shopping around, they were likely acting as a broker earning commission. Sarah's dealer made it seem like a favor, but he was actually steering her toward the finance deal that paid him most.

**No mention of commission** - Close Brothers paid dealers based on the interest rate they secured. Higher rate = higher commission. Were you told about this arrangement? Most customers weren't.

**Unusually high APR** - If your rate seems expensive compared to your credit score, there's probably a reason. Sarah had good credit but got a rate similar to someone with poor credit—because the dealer inflated it.
```

**Why this works:**
- Tells Sarah's story first (engagement)
- Explains the issue (context)
- THEN lists key points (strategic)
- Each list item has explanation (depth)
- Feels like a conversation, not a checklist

---

### 3. Explain WHY, Not Just WHAT

**Bad (What only):**

```markdown
**Key factors affecting compensation:**
1. Commission rate
2. Interest overpayment
3. Agreement term
4. Finance amount
```

**Good (Why + What):**

```markdown
**What affects your Close Brothers compensation?**

Think of your compensation like a calculation puzzle—several pieces need to fit together. The biggest piece? How much extra interest you paid because of inflated rates.

**Commission rate** - Close Brothers paid dealers a percentage based on your interest rate. If your dealer set a 10% rate when you could've had 8%, that 2% difference compounds over years. On an £18,000 loan over 4 years, that's roughly £800 in overpayments.

**Your agreement term** - Longer agreements mean more monthly payments at that inflated rate. Someone with a 5-year agreement will have paid more excess interest than someone with a 3-year deal, so compensation reflects that.

**The finance amount** - Larger loans mean commission structures had bigger impact. An inflated rate on a £30,000 Range Rover has more financial impact than on a £10,000 hatchback.
```

**Why this works:**
- Explains the logic
- Uses real examples (£18,000 loan)
- Shows cause and effect
- Demonstrates expertise
- More valuable to reader

---

### 4. Mix Formats

**Narrative paragraphs (40%):**
- Story elements
- Explanations

---

## 📐 Section Structure Formula

### For Each Major Section:

```markdown
## Section Heading (Question or Benefit-Focused)

[Opening hook - 2-3 sentences]
- Could be a question to reader
- Could be a mini-story
- Could be a surprising fact
- Should create curiosity

[Explanation - 2-3 paragraphs]
- Explain the concept
- Provide context
- Show why it matters
- Use "you" language

[Strategic list - when appropriate]
**When lists add value:**
- List item 1 - with explanation, not just a label
- List item 2 - explain what this means for reader
- List item 3 - add context or examples

[Follow-up paragraph]
- Explain what this means for reader
- Transition to next point
- Add example if helpful

[Optional: Real example or scenario]
"Take David's case: He..." [Tell mini-story]
```

---

## 🎨 Writing Techniques

### 1. The "You" Perspective

**Bad:** "Consumers who had finance between 2007-2021 may be eligible."

**Good:** "If you bought a car on finance between 2007-2021, you might be sitting on a compensation claim without even realizing it."

### 2. Conversational Transitions

**Bad:** [Lists end, next section starts with no transition]

**Good:** "Now that you understand the commission issue, let's talk about how much you could actually receive..."

### 3. Questions to Reader

**Bad:** "The claim process involves several steps."

**Good:** "Ready to find out if you're eligible? Here's exactly what happens when you make a claim..."

### 4. Analogies and Comparisons

**Bad:** "DCAs allowed rate manipulation."

**Good:** "Think of DCAs like a salesperson who gets bigger commission by overcharging you—except in this case, it was hidden in your finance rate."

### 5. Mini-Stories (Even in Bullet Points)

**Bad:**
```markdown
- Felt pressured
- No explanation given
```

**Good:**
```markdown
**Felt pressured into signing** - Remember feeling rushed? "This deal is only available today" or "I need your decision now"—classic pressure tactics that led to poor decisions.

**No explanation of terms** - You signed documents full of legal jargon with the dealer saying "it's all standard stuff." Turns out, it wasn't.
```

## 📊 Format Distribution (Target Ratio)

### In a 2,000-word post:

- **800 words (40%)** - Narrative paragraphs
- **400 words (20%)** - Strategic lists  
- **400 words (20%)** - Examples and scenarios
- **200 words (10%)** - Visual elements (tables, callouts)

### Never exceed:
- ❌ 50% lists (too scan-heavy)
- ❌ 3 consecutive lists without narrative
- ❌ Lists with more than 7 items
- ❌ More than 5 lists per 1,000 words

---

## 🎯 Examples: Before & After

### Example 1: Eligibility Section

**❌ Before (List-Heavy):**

```markdown
## Can I Claim?

You may be eligible if:
1. Finance between 2007-2021
2. Bought from dealership
3. Dealer arranged finance
4. Commission not disclosed

Check if you had:
- PCP finance
- HP finance
- Personal loan
- Conditional sale

Required evidence:
- Finance agreement
- Vehicle details
- Dealer information
- Payment records
```

**✅ After (Narrative + Strategic Lists):**

```markdown
## Can You Claim Against Close Brothers?

Let's figure out if you're one of the hundreds of thousands of Close Brothers customers who could claim compensation.

The key question isn't just "did I have Close Brothers finance?"—it's "was I properly told about the dealer's commission arrangements?" For most customers, the answer is no.

Think back to when you bought your car. Did the dealer explain they'd earn more money if your interest rate was higher? Did they show you alternative lenders? Did you even know Close Brothers was paying them commission? If you're answering "no" to these questions, you've found your answer.

**You're likely eligible if your situation matches these:**

**The dealer "handled everything"** - They positioned themselves as helpful, steering you toward Close Brothers without explaining they had a financial incentive. You thought they were doing you a favor—they were actually maximizing their commission.

**Agreement between 2007-2021** - This was the DCA period when dealers had discretion to inflate your rate. If your Close Brothers finance started in these years, it's worth investigating.

**You were never shown alternatives** - Dealers who earn commission often don't want you shopping around. Did they actively discourage you from checking bank rates or other lenders?

What if you can't remember the details? Don't worry—Close Brothers keeps records for years, and we can retrieve them as part of the claims process. Even if you've lost your paperwork, your claim isn't lost.
```

**Why the second version is better:**
- Opens with direct question to reader
- Explains the key issue first
- THEN lists qualifying factors
- Each list item has explanation and context
- Ends with reassurance (lost paperwork)
- Feels like a conversation
- Shows understanding of customer experience

---

### Example 2: Timeline Section

**❌ Before (Pure List):**

```markdown
## Timeline

Direct claim:
- Week 1-2: Gather info
- Week 3-10: Lender response
- Week 11-14: Negotiation
- Week 15-18: Settlement

Via CMC:
- Week 1-3: Eligibility check
- Week 4-12: Assessment
- Week 13-16: Negotiation
- Week 17-20: Settlement

FOS route:
- Month 1-2: Initial claim
- Month 3: Rejection
- Month 4-5: FOS setup
- Month 6-12: Investigation
```

**✅ After (Narrative + Strategic Timeline):**

```markdown
## How Long Do Close Brothers Claims Take?

Here's the honest truth: claiming takes time. But understanding the timeline helps you set realistic expectations and avoid frustration.

Most Close Brothers claims take 3-5 months from start to finish. That's not long in the grand scheme—especially when you consider you could be claiming for something that happened years ago. But let's break down exactly what happens so you know what to expect.

**The Standard Journey (3-4 months):**

When you submit a claim directly to Close Brothers, they have 8 weeks to respond—that's legally required. In reality, straightforward cases often get responses within 6 weeks. Close Brothers will review your agreement, check their records of dealer commission, and calculate whether you were overcharged.

If they uphold your claim, great! Settlement usually happens within 4-6 weeks after that. If they reject it, you can escalate to the Financial Ombudsman, which adds another 6-8 months (but often results in better outcomes).

**What if you use a claims management company?** The timeline is similar—12-20 weeks total—but you don't have to handle the back-and-forth. We deal with Close Brothers' requests for information, push them on deadlines, and negotiate the settlement amount. Think of it as hiring someone to handle the hassle while you get on with life.

**The Ombudsman route** is slower (6-12 months) but has a major advantage: the Financial Ombudsman's decision is binding on Close Brothers. If the Ombudsman says you're owed £1,200, Close Brothers must pay it—no more negotiation. For claims Close Brothers initially rejected, this is often worth the wait.
```

**Why the second version is better:**
- Sets expectations upfront ("honest truth")
- Explains WHY timelines matter
- Uses narrative to explain process
- Still includes key timeframes but contextually
- Explains trade-offs (speed vs outcomes)
- Sounds like expert advice, not a schedule
- More valuable to reader

## 💡 Remember

**The goal isn't to avoid lists** - they're valuable when used strategically.

**The goal is to sound human** - like an expert friend explaining something important, not a robot reading a checklist.

**Good content teaches, engages, and guides** - all while building trust and demonstrating expertise.

**Users should finish reading and think:**
- "That was helpful"
- "I understand my situation now"
- "These people know what they're talking about"
- "I trust them to help me"

**NOT:**
- "That was just a list of facts"
- "I could have found this anywhere"
- "That felt automated"
- "I'm not sure they actually understand this"
