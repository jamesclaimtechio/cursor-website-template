This document provides key facts, figures, and timeline for the UK motor finance redress scandal to guide content development and ensure accuracy.

## The Scandal in Brief

Millions of UK consumers who purchased vehicles using finance between **2007 and 2024** may have been overcharged due to undisclosed commission arrangements between lenders and car dealers.

### What Went Wrong

Car dealers and brokers received commission from lenders for arranging finance deals. In many cases:

- Commissions were **not disclosed** to consumers
- **Discretionary Commission Arrangements (DCAs)** allowed brokers to increase interest rates to earn higher commission
- Consumers had no opportunity to **negotiate or compare** alternatives
- The higher the interest rate, the more the dealer earned — creating a clear **conflict of interest**

## Types of Commission Arrangements

### 1. Discretionary Commission Arrangements (DCAs)

Brokers could increase the customer's interest rate above the lender's minimum. The higher they set it, the more commission they earned.

> **Status**: Banned since January 2021. Main focus of redress scheme.
> 

### 2. High Commission Arrangements

Fixed commission that was disproportionately high, even if not discretionary.

### 3. Tied Arrangements

Where brokers were tied to a single lender, limiting consumer choice.

## The FCA Redress Scheme (CP25/27)

### Key Features

- **Presumption of harm**: If disclosure was inadequate, there's a presumption the consumer suffered loss
- **Rebuttal available**: Lenders can rebut presumption with evidence (e.g., 0% APR deals)
- **Two remedies proposed**:
    1. Commission repayment
    2. APR adjustment remedy

### The Claims Process

The process for claiming compensation involves:

1. Identifying whether you had a finance agreement between 2007–2024
2. Determining if commission was undisclosed or excessive
3. Submitting a complaint to the lender
4. Calculation of redress based on FCA methodology
5. Right to escalate to Financial Ombudsman if the response is unsatisfactory
