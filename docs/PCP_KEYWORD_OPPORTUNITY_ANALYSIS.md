## 🔍 Competitor Gap Analysis

### What Competitors Are Missing:

1. **PCP-specific detail** - Most talk generically about "car finance claims"
2. **Commission focus** - Not enough emphasis on hidden commission specifically
3. **Brand-specific guides** - No BMW/Audi/Mercedes PCP content
4. **Comparison content** - Lack of PCP vs HP explanations
5. **Transactional pages** - No eligibility checkers

**Your opportunity:** Be the ONLY comprehensive PCP claims resource.

---

## ⚠️ Compliance Considerations

### With PCP content, be extra careful:

**DON'T:**
- ❌ "Average PCP claim is £700" (unless citing industry data)
- ❌ "All PCP claims will succeed"
- ❌ "PCP claims are guaranteed"
- ❌ Specific manufacturer blame without evidence

**DO:**
- ✅ "Industry estimates suggest average compensation of £700"
- ✅ "Check if you're eligible for a PCP claim"
- ✅ "PCP agreements from 2007-2021 may have had hidden commission"
- ✅ Cite FCA sources, Motor Finance Redress doc

**Remember:** PCP is still car finance. Same compliance rules apply.
