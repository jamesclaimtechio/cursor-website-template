# Website Compliance Guidelines (For Cursor)

Rules that affect website copy, design, and user flow for MCC. Drop this in Cursor context when building.

---

## Golden Rule

> All content must be **clear, fair and not misleading**
> 

This applies to every page, every CTA, every piece of copy.

---

## Required Disclosures

These MUST appear on the site:

- [ ]  **FCA authorisation status** and firm reference number
- [ ]  **"We are a Claims Management Company"** — don't let users think you're a law firm
- [ ]  **Fees** — prominently displayed before any signup/engagement
- [ ]  **What services you actually provide** — be specific
- [ ]  **Realistic outcomes** — no guarantees of success

---

## Prohibited Content

Do NOT include any of these:

| ❌ Don't | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Specific payout amounts ("average £700") | Can't substantiate individual outcomes |
| "Lenders are refunding money" | Implies certainty that doesn't exist |
| Pressure tactics ("Claim NOW before deadline!") | Misleading urgency |
| "No win no fee" without asterisk + policy link | Must link to full No Win No Fee policy page |
| Implying FCA covers unregulated services | Halo effect violation |
| Guarantees of success | Misleading |

---

## Fee Transparency

### Fee Cap

- Maximum: 3**0% of compensation + VAT**
- Sliding scale for higher amounts

### Display Requirements

- Fees disclosed **before** any contract/signup
- Clear explanation of **when** fees become payable
- No hidden charges
- Cancellation terms clearly stated

**Suggested placement**: Dedicated fees page + summary in signup flow before form submission.

## Motor Finance Specific Rules

For MCC's motor finance claims focus:

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
| --- | --- |
| Explain what DCAs were | Claim specific payout amounts |
| State the redress scheme launches May 2026 | Say lenders are "refunding" |
| Explain the claims process | Use "guaranteed" or "entitled" |
| Be clear about your fee | Imply urgency without basis |

---

## Consumer Duty UX Requirements

### Pre-Contract (Before Signup)

- [ ]  Clearly explain what service you provide
- [ ]  Explain the fee structure
- [ ]  Make it obvious what they're signing up for

### User Journey

- [ ]  No dark patterns
- [ ]  No confusing CTAs
- [ ]  Easy to understand next steps
- [ ]  No buried terms

### Exit

- [ ]  No pressure to stay
- [ ]  Clear contact for questions

---

## Copy Guidelines

### Headlines

```
✅ "Were you overcharged on car finance?"
✅ "Check if you're eligible for motor finance compensation"
✅ "Hidden commission may mean you're owed money"

❌ "Get your £700 refund NOW!"
❌ "Lenders are paying out — claim yours!"
❌ "Last chance to claim!"
```

### CTAs

```
✅ "Check my eligibility"
✅ "Start my claim"
✅ "Find out if I'm affected"

❌ "Get my money back"
❌ "Claim my refund"
❌ "Don't miss out"
```

### Body Copy Tone

- Factual, not sensational
- Explain the problem clearly
- Be honest about the process and timeline
- Don't oversell outcomes

---

## Footer Requirements

Every page footer should include:

```
[Company Name] is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FRN: XXXXXX) for claims management activities.
```

Plus links to:

- Terms & Conditions
- Privacy Policy
- Fee Structure
- No Win No Fee Policy
- Complaints Procedure

---

## Form/Signup Flow

Before final submission, user must see:

1. **What they're signing up for** (clear service description)
2. **Fee structure** (% of compensation)
3. **Checkbox confirmation** they've read terms
4. **What happens next** (clear next steps)

---

## Quick Reference

| Element | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| FCA number | Visible on every page (footer minimum) |
| Fees | Prominent before engagement |
| "CMC" disclosure | Clear — not a law firm |
| Outcomes | No guarantees, realistic language |
| Urgency | No false pressure |
| Exit | Easy to cancel |
