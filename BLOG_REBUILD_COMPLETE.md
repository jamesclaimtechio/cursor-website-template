## 🎯 Key Transformations (With Examples)

### 1. Opening Paragraphs

**❌ Before (PCP Claims):**
```markdown
If you bought a car using PCP finance between 2007 and 2021, you 
could be eligible to claim compensation for hidden commission.
```

**✅ After:**
```markdown
Picture this: Three years ago, you drove off the forecourt in your 
dream car, excited about the affordable monthly payments on your PCP 
deal. The dealer made it all seem so easy—"I'll sort the finance," 
they said. You trusted them. Fast forward to today: you're learning 
that "sorting the finance" actually meant inflating your interest 
rate to maximize their commission. And nobody told you.
```

**What changed:**
- Story hook instead of statement
- Creates immediate connection
- "You" language throughout
- Engaging opening that keeps reading

---

### 2. Eligibility Sections

**❌ Before (Close Brothers):**
```markdown
You may be eligible if:
1. Finance between 2007-2021
2. Dealer arranged it
3. No commission disclosure
4. Bought from dealership
5. Not told about rates
```

**✅ After:**
```markdown
Let's figure out if you're one of the hundreds of thousands of Close 
Brothers customers who could claim compensation.

The key question isn't just "did I have Close Brothers finance?"—it's 
"was I properly told about the dealer's commission arrangements?" For 
most customers during 2007-2021, the answer is no.

Think back to when you bought your car. Did the dealer explain they'd 
earn more money if your interest rate was higher? Did they show you 
alternative lenders? Did you even know Close Brothers was paying them 
commission? If you're answering "no," you've found your answer.

**The dealer "handled everything"** - They positioned themselves as 
helpful, steering you toward Close Brothers without explaining they 
had a financial incentive. You thought they were doing you a favor—
they were actually maximizing their commission.

**Agreement between 2007-2021** - This was the DCA period when dealers 
had discretion to inflate your rate. If your Close Brothers motor 
finance started in these years, it's worth investigating.
```

**What changed:**
- Context before list
- Each list item has 2-3 sentences explanation
- "You" language throughout
- Explains WHY each point matters
- Much more engaging

---

### 3. Compensation Sections

**❌ Before (Mis-Sold Car Finance):**
```markdown
**Key factors:**
1. Commission rate
2. Interest overpayment
3. Agreement term
4. Finance amount
5. Disclosure quality
```

**✅ After:**
```markdown
**The interest rate you paid vs. what you should have paid** - This 
is the foundational calculation. If your dealer set you at 10.5% APR 
when someone with your credit profile should've got 8% APR, that 2.5% 
difference compounds over the agreement term. Let's do the math: on a 
£20,000 car finance agreement over 4 years, paying 10.5% instead of 8% 
costs you roughly £1,000 in extra interest. That's what you're claiming 
back.

**How long you paid that inflated rate** - Basic math here: if you 
overpaid £20/month in excess interest, and you made payments for 48 
months (4 years), that's £960 total overpayment. Someone with a shorter 
agreement overpaid for fewer months, so their compensation is 
proportionally less.
```

**What changed:**
- Explains WHY each factor matters
- Uses real numbers (£20,000, 4 years, £1,000)
- Shows cause and effect
- Demonstrates expertise through detail
- Much more valuable to reader
