December 2025 marks a pivotal moment in the car finance claims saga. The Financial Conduct Authority's consultation on the motor finance redress scheme closed on 12 December, the complaint handling pause was extended, and we're now in the final countdown to the systematic scheme launching in May 2026.

If you're trying to understand what all these FCA announcements mean for your car finance claim—whether you can claim now, what's changing, and what to expect in the coming months—this guide explains everything that happened in December 2025 and what it means for you.

## What Happened in December 2025? (The Key FCA Announcements)

Let me break down exactly what the FCA announced this month, because there were several developments and it's easy to get confused:

### 1. Motor Finance Consultation Closed (12 December 2025)

The FCA's consultation on the Motor Finance Consumer Redress Scheme (formally known as CP25/27) officially closed on **12 December 2025**. This consultation, which opened on 7 October 2025, gave industry participants, consumer groups, and the public opportunity to respond to the FCA's proposals for how the redress scheme should work.

**What this means:** The consultation phase is over. The FCA now has all the feedback they're going to get. They'll analyze responses, refine their proposals, and publish final rules in early 2026.

**Think of it like this:** The FCA said "here's how we think the scheme should work" in October. Industry and consumers responded with "here's what we think about that" over the next two months. Now the FCA takes that feedback, adjusts the scheme if needed, and publishes the final version that everyone will have to follow.

**For your claim:** This doesn't change anything immediately. Claims submitted before, during, or after the consultation are all still valid. But it's a major milestone—we're moving from "proposed scheme" to "final scheme" in the coming weeks.

### 2. Complaint Handling Pause Extended

The FCA extended the complaint handling pause—the period during which lenders can pause processing certain car finance claims—to **4 December 2025**. This deadline has been extended multiple times as the FCA worked toward finalizing the redress scheme.

**What this actually means:** Despite the pause, lenders have been accepting and processing car finance claims throughout. The "pause" doesn't mean you can't claim—it means lenders had flexibility to pause responses while awaiting regulatory clarity. Now that pause period has officially ended.

**For your claim:** You can absolutely claim now. You've always been able to claim during the pause periods. The pause ending actually removes any excuse lenders had for delayed responses. They should be processing claims actively now.

### 3. Final Rules Expected Early 2026

The FCA confirmed that final rules for the motor finance redress scheme will be published in **early 2026**, ahead of the May 2026 scheme launch. "Early 2026" typically means January-March in FCA terminology.

**What final rules will include:**
- Exact methodology for calculating compensation
- Disclosure standards lenders must assess against
- Timeline requirements for processing claims
- Appeal procedures for consumers unhappy with outcomes
- Lender obligations under the scheme

**For your claim:** Once final rules are published, there will be complete clarity on how your claim will be assessed. No more "proposed" or "consultation"—just definitive rules all lenders must follow.

:::keytakeaway December 2025 Significance
December 2025 marks the transition from consultation to implementation. The FCA has finished gathering input and is now finalizing the scheme that will govern car finance claims for years to come. We're 4-5 months from full scheme launch, and the pieces are falling into place.

## What the FCA's Consultation Revealed

The consultation period (October-December 2025) wasn't just administrative—it revealed important insights about how the scheme will work and what issues remain contentious.

### Industry Responses (What Lenders Said)

**From what we've seen reported:**

**Lenders pushed back on the "presumption of harm" rule** - The FCA proposed that if disclosure was inadequate, consumers are presumed to have suffered loss. Lenders argued this goes too far, that they should be able to rebut this presumption more easily. They're worried about the cost implications (£11 billion industry-wide estimate).

**Some lenders argued their disclosure was adequate** - Particularly for post-2019 agreements (after the FCA's initial market study), some lenders claim they improved disclosure practices. They want credit for this and differentiation from pre-2019 agreements.

**Timeline concerns were raised** - Processing millions of claims systematically will take time. Some lenders argued the May 2026 launch is too aggressive given the scale. They wanted more time to prepare systems and train staff.

**Calculation methodology debates** - Lenders want clarity on exactly how compensation will be calculated. Some argued the FCA's proposed methodologies are too generous to consumers; others wanted more prescriptive formulas to ensure consistency.

### Consumer Group Responses (What Advocates Said)

**Consumer advocates generally supported the scheme but pushed for stronger protections:**

**Stronger presumption of harm** - Consumer groups argued that inadequate disclosure should create an almost irrebuttable presumption of loss. They don't want lenders wiggling out through technical arguments.

**Higher compensation amounts** - Some advocates argued the FCA's calculation methodologies are too conservative and don't fully compensate consumers for the detriment suffered.

**Faster timelines** - Consumer groups want claims processed quickly, not dragged out. They pushed for strict lender response deadlines with penalties for delays.

**Proactive customer contact** - Advocates want lenders required to proactively contact affected customers, not just wait for claims to arrive. "You were affected, here's how to claim" letters to millions of consumers.

**What this tells us:** There's tension between industry (wanting to minimize costs and maximize flexibility) and consumer advocates (wanting maximum consumer protection and compensation). The FCA's final rules will balance these competing interests.

## Can You Claim Car Finance Now? (December 2025)

This is probably the most important practical question following December's announcements: **Can you actually submit a car finance claim right now, or should you wait?**

**The answer is crystal clear: Yes, you can claim now. You should claim now.**

Let me explain why there's confusion and why claiming now is absolutely the right move:

### The Confusion About the "Pause"

The FCA's complaint handling pause created confusion. Many people heard "pause" and thought "I can't claim yet." That's not what the pause meant.

**What the pause actually was:** Flexibility for lenders to delay final responses on claims while regulatory clarity was being developed. It didn't stop you submitting claims. It gave lenders permission to say "we're investigating but waiting for FCA guidance before finalizing our response."

**The pause has now ended (4 December 2025).** But here's the thing: even during the pause, lenders were accepting claims, investigating them, and in many cases, processing them fully. The pause was optional flexibility, not a mandatory stop.

**Some lenders never really paused** - Black Horse, for example, continued processing car finance claims throughout. They used the pause selectively for complex cases but kept handling straightforward claims normally.

### Why You Should Claim Now (Not Wait for May 2026)

**Reason 1: You'll be at the front of the queue**

When the redress scheme launches in May 2026, lenders will have backlogs of claims already submitted. If you claim now, you're in that backlog. If you wait until May, you're behind potentially hundreds of thousands of others who claimed earlier.

**Think of it like this:** The scheme isn't a separate claims portal that opens in May. It's a framework for assessing claims that already exist and new ones that arrive. Getting in now means you're already logged when systematic processing begins.

**Reason 2: Claims submitted now benefit from the scheme**

This is crucial to understand: the final rules and methodology that get published in early 2026 will apply to your claim even if you submitted it in December 2025 or earlier. You're not creating a "pre-scheme claim" that gets assessed differently.

The scheme is retrospective in application. It sets the rules for how all motor finance claims should be assessed—including historical ones already in the system.

**Reason 3: Time is money (literally)**

Your compensation includes 8% statutory interest from when you overpaid. Every month that money sits in the lender's account is another month you're not earning that 8%. The sooner your claim is submitted and assessed, the sooner you get compensation.

**Reason 4: Potential deadlines might emerge**

While the FCA hasn't announced claim deadlines yet, they might as the scheme develops. "Claims must be submitted by [date] to be included in systematic processing." If such deadlines appear, you want to already be submitted.

**Reason 5: No downside to claiming now**

What's the worst that happens if you claim now rather than waiting? Nothing. Your claim sits in the lender's queue, gets assessed under the final scheme rules when published, and you're ahead of people who waited. There's literally no disadvantage.

:::warning Don't Fall for the Waiting Game
Some people think "I'll wait for May 2026 when everything is clearer." But clarity comes in early 2026 with final rules publication—you could be claiming in January 2026 under the finalized rules. And even if you claim now (December 2025), your claim gets assessed under those final rules anyway. Waiting gains you nothing but loses you queue position.
:::

## What Changes When Final Rules Are Published? (Early 2026)

The FCA will publish final rules in early 2026 (probably January-March). Let me explain what this actually changes versus what stays the same:

### What Gets Finalized

**Calculation methodology** - The exact formulas for determining compensation. Currently "proposed," soon "mandated." Every lender will have to use the same calculation approach, creating consistency. No more lender discretion on compensation math.

**Disclosure standards** - Clear definition of what constitutes "adequate disclosure." Currently there's some ambiguity. Final rules will specify: what needed to be explained, how clearly, in what format. This gives everyone certainty about whether historical disclosure met the bar.

**Presumption of harm details** - The principle (inadequate disclosure = presumption of loss) is established. Final rules will clarify exactly when this presumption applies, what evidence lenders need to rebut it, and what counts as "inadequate disclosure."

**Lender obligations and timelines** - Specific requirements for how quickly lenders must process claims, what information they must provide consumers, how appeals work if you disagree with their assessment.

**Scheme governance** - Who oversees the scheme, how complaints about the scheme itself are handled, how the FCA will monitor lender compliance.

### What Stays the Same

**Eligibility criteria** - Finance agreements between 2007-2021 (mainly) involving discretionary commission. This won't change. If you're eligible now, you'll be eligible under final rules.

**The legal basis** - Consumer Credit Act 1974, Supreme Court precedent, unfair relationships framework. The law doesn't change—the scheme just implements it systematically.

**Your right to claim** - Whether final rules are published or not, you have legal rights to claim for mis-sold finance. The scheme makes it easier and more systematic, but it doesn't create rights that didn't exist before.

**The claims process** - Submit to lender, they investigate, they respond, you can escalate to Ombudsman if unhappy. This process remains. The scheme just standardizes how lenders assess and what remedies they offer.

## Timeline: December 2025 to May 2026 (What Happens When)

Let me map out the next five months so you understand when things happen and when you should take action:

### December 2025 (NOW)

**What's happening:**
- Consultation responses being analyzed by FCA
- Lenders preparing for final rules and scheme launch
- Claims continuing to be submitted and processed
- Industry working groups planning implementation

**What you should do:**
- **Submit your claim if you haven't already**
- Don't wait for "more clarity"—final rules will apply to your claim anyway
- Get in the queue now

### January 2026 (Expected)

**What's happening:**
- FCA likely publishes final rules (possibly January, definitely by March)
- Complete clarity on calculation methodology
- Disclosure standards finalized
- Scheme governance established

**What you should do:**
- If you claimed already: Monitor for updates, no action needed
- If you haven't claimed: Submit in January under the now-finalized rules
- Read final rules when published (we'll analyze and explain them)

### February-March 2026

**What's happening:**
- Lenders implementing final scheme rules in their systems
- Staff training on new assessment methodologies
- Technology updates to handle systematic processing
- Dress rehearsals for May launch

**What you should do:**
- If you've claimed: Your claim is being prepared for systematic processing
- Check for any FCA guidance on consumer actions
- Possibly receive communication from your lender about their preparations

### April 2026

**What's happening:**
- Final preparations for scheme launch
- Lenders may begin communicating with customers who haven't claimed
- Possibly public information campaigns about the scheme
- One month to go

**What you should do:**
- If you've claimed: You're in position for May launch
- If you haven't: This is truly last call before scheme launches
- Expect increased media coverage creating surge in public awareness

### May 2026 (SCHEME LAUNCHES)

**What happens:**
- Systematic processing begins across all lenders
- Backlog of existing claims processed first (this is why claiming now matters)
- New claims accepted and processed under scheme framework
- FCA actively monitoring lender compliance

**What you'll see:**
- Claims that have been pending start getting resolved
- Lenders working through queues systematically
- Regular updates if you're in the system
- Compensation starting to flow to consumers

## What This Means for Your Car Finance Claim Right Now

Let's get practical. You're reading this in December 2025, the consultation has just closed, and you're wondering what to actually do. Here's your action plan:

### If You Haven't Claimed Yet

**Do it now—this month if possible.** Here's why December 2025 is actually an ideal time to claim:

**The consultation has closed** - The FCA has all the information they need. Final rules are being drafted. The scheme is real and imminent—not theoretical anymore.

**Claims submitted now will benefit from systematic processing** - Your claim gets logged, investigated, and queued for systematic processing when the scheme launches in May. You'll be in the first wave of scheme assessments.

**Queue position matters** - With up to 14 million potentially eligible consumers, being early in the queue means faster resolution once systematic processing begins. Last in queue might wait months longer than first in queue.

**No risk in claiming early** - The absolute worst that happens is your claim sits in a queue for a few months. But you lose nothing by submitting now versus January or April. Meanwhile, you secure your position.

**How to claim:** You can submit directly to your lender (free) or use our no win no fee service. Either way, get your claim into the system before the final rules are even published. Your claim will be assessed under those final rules when they arrive.

### If You've Already Claimed

**Good news: You're in position.** Your claim is already in the lender's system. Here's what will happen:

**Between now and May 2026:** Your lender is probably holding your claim in a queue awaiting final FCA rules. They might have done initial investigation, but they're likely waiting for methodology clarity before finalizing offers. This is normal—you're not being ignored.

**When final rules publish (Jan-Mar 2026):** Your lender will assess your claim against the new methodology. If they've already made an offer, they might review it to ensure it complies with final rules. If they haven't responded yet, they'll respond using the finalized framework.

**When scheme launches (May 2026):** Your claim enters systematic processing. If it's been pending, it now gets active handling. You should expect communication from your lender with updates, timelines, and either offers or requests for additional information.

**Your position is good** - You're ahead of people who wait to claim. When scheme processing begins, you're already in the system.

### If Your Claim Was Rejected Recently

**Don't assume rejection is final.** Here's what's happening:

Some lenders have been rejecting claims during the consultation period, banking on (hoping?) that final rules might be less consumer-friendly than proposals. Now that consultation has closed and rules are being finalized, those rejections might not hold up.

**Consider:** Escalate to the Financial Ombudsman Service. The Ombudsman assesses claims independently using consumer protection law and regulatory guidance. Many claims rejected at lender level succeed at Ombudsman level. The consultation closing and upcoming final rules might actually strengthen your Ombudsman case.

**Alternatively:** Wait for final rules publication (Jan-Mar 2026), then re-submit or appeal your rejection citing the new framework. Some lenders might reassess historical rejections in light of finalized scheme requirements.

## Key Takeaways from the FCA's Proposals (October 2025)

While final rules aren't published yet, the FCA's October 2025 consultation proposals (CP25/27) give us strong indication of what's coming. Let me summarize the key points:

### The Presumption of Harm Framework

**This is the most significant consumer protection in the proposals:**

If commission arrangements weren't adequately disclosed, there's a presumption you suffered financial loss. The burden shifts to lenders—they must prove adequate disclosure occurred, not you proving it didn't.

**Why this is powerful:** For years, consumers had to prove they were harmed. "I wasn't told" vs lender saying "we mentioned it in documents." Now, if disclosure was inadequate (and for most 2007-2021 agreements, it was), harm is presumed. Lenders must prove otherwise.

**What "adequate disclosure" means:** Not just mentioning commission somewhere in 50 pages. The FCA proposals suggest adequate disclosure means:
- Explaining the dealer had discretion over your rate
- Disclosing they'd earn MORE by setting it HIGHER
- The specific conflict of interest being made clear
- Opportunity for you to question or negotiate

Most finance agreements from 2007-2021 didn't meet this standard. Hence, presumption of harm will apply to most claims.

### Two Remedy Approaches

**The FCA proposed two ways to calculate compensation:**

**Remedy 1: Return the commission** - Simply give back what the dealer earned, plus 8% statutory interest. If the dealer earned £1,500 commission on your finance, you get £1,500 back plus interest (could be another £400-500 if the finance was years ago). Total: £1,900-2,000.

**Remedy 2: Return the excess interest** - Calculate what interest rate you should have had, determine how much extra you paid, refund that amount plus 8% interest. If you overpaid £800 in interest, you get £800 plus statutory interest (maybe £200), total: £1,000.

**Which remedy applies to you depends on your circumstances.** Some claims will be assessed under Remedy 1, others under Remedy 2, based on what the commission structure was and how disclosure failed.

**Industry feedback suggested most lenders prefer Remedy 2** (often results in lower payouts). Consumer groups preferred Remedy 1 (often more generous). The final rules will clarify which remedy applies when.

### Rebuttal Rights (Lender Defenses)

**Lenders can rebut the presumption of harm if they prove:**

**Adequate disclosure occurred** - They have documented evidence you were properly informed about commission arrangements and gave informed consent. High bar to clear, but possible in some cases.

**No financial loss occurred** - Even if disclosure was inadequate, they prove you didn't actually suffer loss. Example: 0% APR deals where no interest was charged, so discretion over rates was irrelevant.

**Consumer benefited from arrangement** - Harder to prove, but theoretically possible. Maybe you got a better overall deal because of the commission structure somehow? Weak argument in most cases.

**Final rules will clarify exactly what evidence lenders need** to successfully rebut presumption. Based on consultation, the bar will likely be high—but not impossible.

## What Happens Next: FCA Timeline to May 2026

Let me give you a month-by-month roadmap based on what the FCA has indicated:

### January 2026 (Most Likely)

**Expected:** FCA publishes Policy Statement with final rules

**What gets published:**
- Definitive scheme rules (not proposals anymore)
- Final calculation methodologies
- Disclosure standards all lenders must apply
- Timeline requirements for claim processing
- Consumer rights and appeal procedures

**What this means for you:**
- Complete clarity on how claims will be assessed
- If you haven't claimed yet, you can now claim under finalized rules
- If you have claimed, you'll see how the final rules apply to your case

### February-March 2026

**Expected:** Implementation period

**What's happening:**
- Lenders updating systems based on final rules
- Staff training on new methodologies
- Technology builds for systematic processing
- Possibly soft-launch or pilot processing

**What you might see:**
- Communication from your lender about preparations
- Updates on your existing claim status
- Industry announcements about readiness

### April 2026

**Expected:** Final preparations

**What's happening:**
- Last-minute system testing
- Lender readiness reviews
- FCA checking lenders are prepared
- Public awareness campaigns possibly

**What you might see:**
- Media coverage increasing
- Friends/family asking about claims
- Lenders sending preparation letters to customers

### May 2026

**SCHEME LAUNCHES**

**What happens:**
- Systematic processing begins across all lenders
- Backlog claims get actively processed
- New claims accepted under scheme
- Regular updates to claimants
- Compensation starting to flow

**What you'll experience:**
- If you've claimed: Active processing begins, expect updates
- If you haven't: Scheme is now fully operational for new claims
- Timeline expectations become clearer
- First wave of compensation payments start arriving

### June-December 2026

**Mass Processing Period**

**What's happening:**
- Millions of claims being processed
- Systematic methodology applied consistently
- Regular compensation payments flowing
- FCA monitoring lender compliance
- Ombudsman handling escalations

**What you'll see:**
- Your claim moving through the process
- Possibly compensation arriving
- Stories from others receiving payouts
- The scheme operating at full scale

**The full processing of all eligible claims will probably take 12-24 months** from May 2026 launch. So we're looking at completion potentially by mid-2027 or later.

## How December 2025 Developments Affect Different Lenders

Let me give you lender-specific insight on how the December announcements and upcoming final rules might affect claims with different lenders:

### Black Horse (UK's Largest Motor Finance Lender)

**Current status:** Black Horse has been processing claims throughout consultation periods. They've handled thousands already.

**Impact of final rules:** As the largest lender with the most claims, Black Horse will be under intense FCA scrutiny. They'll need to demonstrate systematic, fair processing. This is good for consumers—they can't afford to be seen dragging their feet.

**Your claim with Black Horse:** Likely to be processed efficiently once systematic processing begins. They have infrastructure and experience. Timeline: probably toward the faster end (3-4 months from May 2026).

### Close Brothers (Named in Supreme Court Case)

**Current status:** Close Brothers was specifically named in the August 2025 Supreme Court case. They're acutely aware of legal precedent.

**Impact of final rules:** The Supreme Court ruling already established Close Brothers' practices created unfair relationships. Final FCA rules will provide additional framework, but they're already operating under court precedent.

**Your claim with Close Brothers:** Strong legal foundation (Supreme Court case). Final rules will likely reinforce what the court already established. Timeline: standard (3-5 months from May 2026).

### Santander Consumer Finance

**Current status:** Santander has been processing claims but more conservatively than some lenders. They're a bank with reputation concerns.

**Impact of final rules:** Standardized methodology means Santander can't be more conservative than required. They'll need to follow FCA rules like everyone else. Could actually benefit consumers if their current approach is below what rules mandate.

**Your claim with Santander:** Expect systematic processing under clear rules from May 2026. As a major bank with resources, they'll comply fully. Timeline: standard (3-5 months from scheme launch).

Learn more: [Santander Car Finance Claims](/car-finance-claims/santander-car-finance-claims)

### Smaller/Specialist Lenders

**Current status:** MotoNovo, Moneybarn, specialist lenders have generally been slower processing claims. Fewer resources, less experience with high complaint volumes.

**Impact of final rules:** The scheme will require systematic processing from ALL lenders, regardless of size. Smaller lenders will need to scale up capabilities. The FCA will monitor compliance—can't just be slow because they're small.

**Your claims with smaller lenders:** May take longer initially (they're building capabilities), but the scheme requirements should bring them up to standard. Timeline: possibly toward longer end (4-6 months from launch), but improving as they develop processes.

## Common Questions About December 2025 FCA Announcements

### What does the consultation closing actually mean?

**It means the feedback period is over.** The FCA asked "what do you think of our proposals?" Industry, consumer groups, and individuals responded. Now the FCA analyzes that feedback and incorporates it (where appropriate) into final rules.

Think of it like this: Proposal → Consultation → Finalization → Implementation. We've just completed the consultation stage. Finalization is happening now (behind scenes at the FCA). Implementation begins May 2026.

**For you:** It's a milestone toward the scheme becoming real, but it doesn't immediately change anything about your ability to claim or how claims are assessed right now.

### Can lenders still reject my claim in December 2025?

**Yes, they can reject claims at any time.** The consultation closing doesn't prevent lender rejections. However:

**Lenders know final rules are coming** - If they reject your claim now, you can appeal citing final rules once published. Some lenders are being more cautious about rejections because rules might establish stronger consumer protections than they're currently applying.

**You can always escalate** - Lender rejection isn't final. The Financial Ombudsman Service provides independent review. Many rejected claims succeed at Ombudsman level.

**The upcoming scheme might strengthen your position** - If a lender rejects now and final rules publish in January with strong consumer protections, your appeal becomes stronger. Some people are strategically waiting for final rules before appealing rejections.

### Will final rules make claims easier or harder?

**Based on consultation proposals: Easier for consumers.**

**Consumer-friendly elements:**
- Presumption of harm (shifts burden to lenders)
- Clear disclosure standards (most 2007-2021 disclosure will fail)
- Systematic processing requirements (lenders can't just ignore claims)
- Consistent methodology (removes lender discretion)

**Lender-friendly elements (based on their consultation responses):**
- Some rebuttal rights (they can prove adequate disclosure)
- Possibly more modest calculation methodologies than consumers wanted
- Gradual implementation (not everything at once)

**Net effect:** The scheme makes it easier for consumers with legitimate claims to succeed. It creates structure, consistency, and burden-shifting that benefit consumers overall.

### What if the FCA changes everything in final rules?

**Unlikely.** Consultation isn't "start from scratch" process—it's "refine the proposals" process.

**The core elements are locked in:**
- Presumption of harm framework
- Systematic processing requirement
- Two remedy approaches
- May 2026 launch

**What might change in final rules:**
- Specific calculation formulas (tweaked based on feedback)
- Disclosure standards (clarified but not fundamentally altered)
- Timeline requirements (adjusted for practicality)
- Rebuttal evidence standards (refined)

**But the fundamental scheme structure won't radically change.** The FCA doesn't propose frameworks, consult for months, then completely abandon them. They refine, clarify, adjust—but the core remains.

## Your Action Plan Following December 2025 Announcements

Right, you understand what the FCA announced, what's coming, and what it all means. What should you actually do?

### This Week: Submit Your Claim or Check Eligibility

**If you haven't claimed and think you're eligible:**

The absolute best action following December's FCA announcements is getting your claim submitted. Don't overthink it. Don't wait for final rules (they'll apply to your claim anyway). Don't wait for May 2026 (you'll be back of queue).

**Use our free eligibility check** ([PCP claim check](/car-finance-claims/pcp-claim-check) takes 2 minutes) to verify you qualify, then either:
- Claim yourself directly with your lender (free)
- Instruct us to handle it (no win no fee)

**Get in the queue this month.** December 2025 to May 2026 is 5 months. Your claim can be investigated, processed, and potentially settled before the scheme even launches—or at minimum, you'll be first wave when it does launch.

### This Month: Stay Informed About Final Rules

**When the FCA publishes final rules (expected January 2026):**

We'll analyze them and publish detailed guidance on what changed from proposals, what it means for claims, and how it affects your specific situation. Sign up for updates or check back regularly.

If you have a rejected claim, final rules might provide new grounds for appeal. If you have a pending claim, final rules will clarify how it'll be assessed. If you haven't claimed yet, final rules will show you exactly what framework will assess your claim.

**Follow reliable sources:**
- FCA website (fca.org.uk) for official announcements
- Our blog (we'll analyze and explain in plain English)
- Financial Ombudsman for guidance on escalations

### January-April 2026: Position for Scheme Launch

**If you claim between now and April:**

You'll be in excellent position. Your claim will be investigated under final rules, queued for systematic processing, and ready for May launch. You're not in the last-minute rush, but you're not so early that you've been waiting years.

**If you claimed months ago:**

Your patience is about to pay off. The scheme launch means active, systematic processing. Claims that have been pending should start moving. You'll finally see progress.

**December 2025 marks a turning point in car finance claims.**

The consultation is closed, final rules are being drafted, the May 2026 launch is imminent. This isn't theoretical anymore—it's happening. If you had car finance between 2007-2021 and weren't properly told about dealer commission arrangements, the time to act is now, not later.

The FCA's work in December 2025—closing consultation, extending deadlines, finalizing frameworks—all builds toward systematic consumer redress. You have rights, those rights are being formalized into a structured scheme, and compensation is coming to millions. The question isn't "will this happen?"—it's "are you in the queue when it does?"

:::keytakeaway Take Action in December 2025
Following the FCA's December announcements, the optimal time to claim is NOW. Get your claim submitted before final rules publish (they'll apply to it anyway), before the May 2026 rush (queue position matters), and before any deadlines emerge (better early than late). Check your eligibility, submit your claim, and position yourself for the systematic processing that begins in May.

      question: "What did the FCA announce in December 2025?",
      answer: "In December 2025, the FCA closed the motor finance consultation (CP25/27) on 12 December after receiving industry and consumer feedback. They extended the complaint handling pause and confirmed final rules will be published in early 2026, ahead of the May 2026 redress scheme launch."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I claim car finance in December 2025?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely. You can submit car finance claims now. The consultation closing doesn't prevent claims—it just marks the end of feedback period. Claims submitted now will be assessed under the final rules when published in early 2026. Don't wait—get in the queue before May 2026."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens after the FCA consultation closes?",
      answer: "After the consultation closed on 12 December 2025, the FCA will analyze all feedback, refine their proposals, and publish final rules in early 2026 (likely January-March). These final rules will establish the exact framework for the May 2026 redress scheme launch."
    },
    {
      question: "When will the FCA publish final car finance rules?",
      answer: "The FCA will publish final rules in early 2026, likely January-March, ahead of the May 2026 scheme launch. These rules will clarify calculation methodologies, disclosure standards, lender obligations, and consumer rights under the systematic redress scheme."
    },
    {
      question: "What does FCA December 2025 mean for my claim?",
      answer: "December 2025 marks the transition from consultation to finalization. Your claim remains valid whether submitted before, during, or after consultation. Claims submitted now will be assessed under final rules when published. The consultation closing brings us closer to May 2026 systematic processing—get your claim in the queue."
