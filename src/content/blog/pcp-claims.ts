Picture this: Three years ago, you drove off the forecourt in your dream car, excited about the affordable monthly payments on your PCP deal. The dealer made it all seem so easy—"I'll sort the finance," they said. You trusted them. Fast forward to today: you're learning that "sorting the finance" actually meant inflating your interest rate to maximize their commission. And nobody told you.

If this sounds familiar, you're not alone. Millions of UK consumers who used PCP finance between 2007 and 2021 are discovering they were caught up in the hidden commission scandal that's now making headlines.

## What is a PCP Claim?

Let's start with the basics, because the terminology can get confusing quickly.

:::definition PCP Claims
A PCP claim is a compensation claim for mis-sold Personal Contract Purchase finance, typically involving hidden commission arrangements where car dealers earned money from your finance agreement without properly disclosing it to you.
:::

Here's what actually happened: Between 2007 and 2021, car dealers didn't just sell you a car—they acted as credit brokers, arranging finance deals with lenders. Nothing wrong with that, except they had something called Discretionary Commission Arrangements. These DCAs allowed them to adjust your interest rate, and here's the kicker: the higher they set your rate, the more money they made. You were paying extra interest every month, and that money was going straight into their pocket as commission.

Think of it like a salesperson who could choose how much to charge you, knowing they'd earn a bigger bonus for charging more. Except in this case, it was hidden in your APR, buried in paperwork, and never properly explained.

The Financial Conduct Authority eventually banned these arrangements in January 2021, but the damage was done. If you had PCP finance before then, you likely paid more than you needed to—and now you can claim that money back.

## What is PCP Finance? (And Why It Matters)

Before we dive deeper into claims, let's make sure we're on the same page about what PCP actually is—because not everyone realizes they even had it.

**Personal Contract Purchase (PCP)** became the most popular way to finance a car in the UK, and dealers loved pushing it for good reason: the commission opportunities were substantial.

Here's how your PCP deal probably worked:

You put down a deposit (maybe 10% of the car's value), then made monthly payments for 2-4 years. But here's the thing: you weren't paying off the car. You were paying off the depreciation—the difference between what the car cost and what it'll be worth at the end. That's why your monthly payments were lower than a traditional car loan.

At the end of your agreement, you faced a choice: return the car and walk away, trade it in for another PCP deal, or pay a big final "balloon payment" to actually own it. Most people chose option two—which meant dealers got to earn commission all over again on your next car.

:::keytakeaway Why PCP Was Perfect for Hidden Commission
Those lower monthly payments made expensive cars seem affordable. A BMW that would've cost £600/month on a loan suddenly looked manageable at £350/month on PCP. Dealers could package up the finance quickly, you got the car you wanted, and nobody mentioned the dealer was earning anywhere from £500 to £3,000+ in commission by setting your interest rate at the high end of their discretionary range.
:::

**The key difference between PCP and other finance:** You don't own the car unless you make that final balloon payment. This flexibility made PCP hugely popular—and gave dealers massive opportunities to earn undisclosed commission.

## Why Are People Claiming on PCP?

The PCP claims scandal came to light when consumers and regulators started asking a simple question: "Why were we never told about this?"

Let me walk you through what happened, because understanding this helps you realize why your claim is legitimate—not some "too good to be true" scheme.

### The Hidden Commission Arrangement

Between 2007 and 2021, here's how the system worked behind the scenes:

**Step 1:** You walked into a dealership, found a car you loved, and started talking about payments. The dealer was friendly, helpful—made you feel comfortable.

**Step 2:** When it came to finance, they said "let me see what I can do for you." They'd disappear for a few minutes, come back with a PCP quote, and make it sound like they'd negotiated hard on your behalf. "I got you approved at 9.9%," they'd say proudly.

**Step 3:** What they didn't tell you: The lender (Close Brothers, Black Horse, Santander—whoever it was) had actually given them a rate range. Maybe 7% to 12%. The dealer chose 9.9% not because that's what you deserved based on your credit, but because it maximized their commission.

**Step 4:** You signed the paperwork, excited about your new car. The finance seemed reasonable. You had no idea the dealer had discretion to give you 7% instead of 9.9%. Nobody disclosed this arrangement.

**Step 5:** For the next 3-4 years, you made your monthly payments. Every single payment included interest calculated on that inflated rate. That extra 2.9% wasn't going to the lender—it was funding the dealer's commission.

This is what happened to millions of PCP customers. The FCA estimates up to **14 million consumers** were affected by motor finance commission issues, with PCP being the dominant finance type during this period.

### The Supreme Court Said This Was Wrong

In August 2025, the Supreme Court examined these arrangements and partially upheld that they constituted "unfair relationships" under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. The key finding: dealers needed to get your informed consent before earning commission by inflating your rate. For most PCP customers, that informed consent never happened.

This wasn't a minor technical breach. The court recognized that you were paying more money every month, for years, without knowing why—and that's fundamentally unfair.

### The Scale of the Issue

Let's put some numbers on this, because understanding the scale helps you see this is legitimate:

The FCA estimates the total cost to the motor finance industry could exceed **£11 billion**. That's not a typo. Eleven billion pounds in compensation payments. The average payout is estimated at around **£700 per agreement**, though this varies significantly based on individual circumstances.

Why so much? Because during 2007-2021, PCP was everywhere. Dealer forecourts, car supermarkets, even online retailers—everyone was offering PCP, and almost everyone was using DCAs to boost commission. It became the industry standard, which made it seem normal. But just because everyone was doing it doesn't make it right.

## Can I Claim on PCP Finance?

Now let's figure out if you're one of the millions who could claim. Don't worry if you can't remember all the details—we'll work through this step by step.

### The Basic Requirements

Your PCP claim is likely to succeed if your situation matches these circumstances. I'm going to walk through each one and explain why it matters, because understanding the logic helps you assess your own case.

**You had PCP finance between 2007 and 2021** - This timeframe is crucial. DCAs were legal (though ethically questionable) during these years. The FCA didn't ban them until January 2021. If your PCP started in this window, you're in the right timeframe. Even if you've long since finished paying, or returned the car, or traded it in—you can still claim.

**A dealer arranged your finance** - Here's what this actually means: if you bought from a car dealership (not privately from someone), and they "sorted the finance" for you, they were almost certainly acting as a credit broker. Even if they said "we work with [Lender Name]," they were arranging it and earning commission. The key indicator: did you apply directly to a bank yourself, or did the dealer handle it? If the dealer handled it, you're eligible.

**You weren't told about commission arrangements** - Think carefully about this. Did the dealer sit you down and explain: "I can set your interest rate anywhere from 7% to 12%, and I'll earn more commission if I choose a higher rate"? Almost certainly not. At most, they might have mentioned "we receive a fee for arranging finance" in vague terms buried in paperwork. That's not adequate disclosure.

**You paid higher interest than necessary** - You might not know the exact rate you "should" have got, and that's fine. The point is: if the dealer had discretion over your rate, and they chose a higher rate to earn more commission, you overpaid. The claim process will determine exactly how much.

:::warning Even If You're Not Sure...
Many people think "I had good credit, surely my rate was fair?" or "The dealer seemed honest." But DCAs meant even customers with excellent credit could be given higher rates simply because it earned dealers more money. If you meet the basic criteria above, it's worth checking—you might be surprised.
:::

### Common PCP Claim Scenarios

Let me share some typical situations where claims succeed. See if any sound familiar:

**The "I'll handle everything" scenario** - The dealer made the whole process easy. They barely asked about your finances, didn't show you alternatives, just came back with a PCP quote and moved straight to "where do I sign?" Red flag: they weren't trying to find you the best deal—they were trying to close a sale with maximum commission.

**The "manufacturer finance" scenario** - You thought you were getting BMW Finance, VW Finance, or Audi Finance directly from the manufacturer. Actually, these were often underwritten by lenders like Close Brothers or Black Horse, with the dealer still earning discretionary commission. The manufacturer branding made it seem official, but the same commission structures applied.

**The "upgrade treadmill" scenario** - You handed back your PCP car after 3 years and immediately got into another PCP deal. The dealer said "great news, you're pre-approved!" What they meant: "great news, I'm about to earn commission on your new PCP the same way I did on your last one." If you had multiple PCP deals from 2007-2021, you can claim on all of them.

**The "I needed the car" scenario** - Maybe you felt you had no choice. You needed a car for work, the dealer said this was the best rate available, you believed them. That's exactly why DCAs were problematic—you couldn't make an informed decision because you didn't have the full picture.

## How Much Can I Get from a PCP Claim?

Let's talk numbers, but let's be realistic about it because this is where a lot of claims companies oversell and then disappoint people.

The FCA estimates the industry-wide average payout at approximately **£700 per agreement**. Notice the word "average"—this is crucial. Some people will get £200. Others will get £2,000. It depends entirely on your specific circumstances, and anyone promising you'll definitely get £700 is misleading you.

### What Actually Determines Your Compensation?

Think of your PCP claim compensation like a puzzle with several pieces that need to fit together. Let me explain each piece:

**The commission the dealer earned** - This is the starting point. If your dealer earned £1,500 commission by choosing a higher rate for you, that's the baseline we're looking at. But here's the thing: you don't get back the dealer's commission amount. You get back what you overpaid in interest because of their rate choice.

**The interest rate difference** - Let's say your dealer set your PCP at 9.9% APR when the lender would've accepted 7.5% APR for someone with your credit profile. That 2.4% difference is what matters. On an £18,000 PCP over 4 years, paying 9.9% instead of 7.5% costs you roughly £900 in extra interest. That's what you'd claim back.

**Your agreement length** - PCP terms were typically 2-4 years. Longer terms mean more monthly payments at that inflated rate. If you had a 4-year PCP, you overpaid for 48 months. If someone else had a 2-year deal, they overpaid for only 24 months. Compensation reflects this difference.

**The size of your PCP** - An inflated interest rate on a £30,000 Range Rover PCP has more financial impact than on a £10,000 hatchback. The percentage difference is the same, but the pound amount is much larger. High-value PCP claims can be worth £1,500-2,000+, while smaller deals might be £300-500.

:::keytakeaway Example Calculation
Let's use real numbers: Sarah had an £18,000 PCP in 2017 at 9.9% APR over 4 years. Investigation revealed her dealer had discretion to offer 7.5%-11.5%, and chose 9.9% to earn commission. If a fair rate would've been 8%, she overpaid approximately £720 in interest. Add 8% statutory interest on top (that's about £150 more), and her total compensation: £870. Close to that £700 average, but calculated specifically for her situation.
:::

### What About Multiple PCP Deals?

Here's where compensation can really add up: if you had several PCP agreements during 2007-2021, you can claim on each one individually.

Let's say you had three PCP deals in 2015, 2018, and 2020—not uncommon if you were on the "PCP treadmill" of upgrading every few years. Each agreement had its own inflated rate, its own overpayments. You could claim:
- 2015 PCP: £650
- 2018 PCP: £800  
- 2020 PCP: £550
- **Total: £2,000**

This is why some people are receiving significantly more than the £700 average—they had multiple affected agreements.

### Managing Expectations

I need to be straight with you about something: not every PCP claim will succeed at the full amount you hoped for. Some claims get partially upheld (you get compensation but less than calculated). Some get rejected if the lender can prove they disclosed adequately.

The point isn't to guarantee you'll get a specific amount. The point is: if you had PCP between 2007-2021 and weren't properly told about commission arrangements, you have a legitimate claim worth investigating. The worst that happens? You find out you're not eligible. The best that happens? You get back hundreds of pounds you overpaid.

## How to Make a PCP Claim

Right, you understand what PCP claims are, you think you're eligible, you're wondering what to do next. Let's walk through the actual process—and I'll be honest about both routes you can take.

### Your Two Options

You have a choice here, and I want to lay out both options fairly because this is ultimately your decision.

**Option 1: Claim yourself (completely free)** - You have the absolute right to write directly to your lender and make a PCP claim at no cost. This is your legal right under UK consumer law. Zero fees, total control over the process. The catch? You'll need to handle all the paperwork, know what evidence lenders require, negotiate yourself, and potentially escalate to the Financial Ombudsman if they reject your claim. It's doable—thousands of people do it—but it requires time and persistence.

**Option 2: Use a claims management company (no win, no fee)** - Companies like us handle everything for you. We check eligibility, gather documents, submit professionally-prepared claims, negotiate with lenders, and escalate to the Ombudsman if needed. You don't pay anything upfront, and you only pay our fee if we successfully recover compensation. The catch? Our fee is typically 30% + VAT of your compensation, so you'll keep about 70% of what we win. But you don't have to deal with any of the hassle.

Neither option is wrong. It depends on your circumstances. Got time and confidence to navigate the process yourself? Option 1 saves you money. Want someone experienced to handle it while you get on with life? Option 2 removes the stress.

### If You Decide to Claim Yourself

Here's what you'll need to do:

Start by gathering your information—vehicle details, approximate finance dates, lender name if you remember it. Don't worry if you've lost your paperwork; lenders keep records for years.

Write to your lender explaining you're making a PCP claim for undisclosed commission arrangements. Reference Discretionary Commission Arrangements (DCAs), cite the Supreme Court ruling from August 2025, and request information about any commission paid to the dealer who arranged your finance. Ask for compensation under the unfair relationship provisions of the Consumer Credit Act 1974.

They have **8 weeks** to respond. They'll investigate, check their records of dealer commission, and either uphold your claim (offering compensation), reject it (explaining why), or make a partial offer.

If they reject your claim or you're unhappy with their offer, you can escalate to the Financial Ombudsman Service for free. The Ombudsman investigates independently, and their decision is binding on the lender (but not on you—you can reject it and go to court if you want).

### If You Use Our Service

We handle everything I just described, but with years of experience knowing exactly what lenders need to see, how to present your claim for maximum chance of success, and how to negotiate effectively.

When you check your eligibility with us (free, takes 2 minutes), we'll verify your PCP details, confirm you're in the right timeframe, and explain what we can realistically recover. No pressure, no obligation—just straight answers. If you're eligible and want to proceed, we gather everything needed, submit a comprehensive claim, and fight for maximum compensation.

**Our fee structure is simple:** Nothing upfront. Nothing if we don't win. 30% + VAT only on successful compensation. You keep 70%. If we recover £1,000, you get £700, we get £300. Fair, transparent, and you risk nothing.

:::warning Why We Don't Guarantee Amounts
You'll see some claims companies promising "you'll get £700" or showing inflated payout calculators. We don't do that because every PCP claim is different. Your rate, your term, your lender, your circumstances—these all affect compensation. We promise to fight for maximum compensation for your specific case, not to hit some arbitrary number.
:::

## How Long Do PCP Claims Take?

Let's set realistic expectations on timelines, because one of the biggest complaints about claims processes is people feeling kept in the dark.

Most PCP claims take somewhere between 3 and 6 months from start to finish. I know that seems like a long time when you're waiting for money you're owed, but there's a process that has to unfold, and it's worth understanding why.

### The Typical Journey (3-5 Months)

**Weeks 1-2: Getting started** - Whether you're claiming yourself or using us, the first couple of weeks involve gathering information. Your lender needs specific details: vehicle registration, finance dates, agreement numbers. If you don't have paperwork, we (or you) request it from the lender, which adds a week or two.

**Weeks 3-10: Lender assessment** - This is the mandatory part. Lenders have 8 weeks to respond to your claim under FCA rules. They'll pull your agreement from their archives, check what commission was paid to the dealer, review what disclosure (if any) you received, and calculate whether you overpaid. Some lenders respond in 6 weeks, others use the full 8, and a few ask for extensions if they need more information.

**Weeks 11-14: Negotiation** - If the lender upholds your claim, there might be back-and-forth on the amount. They might offer £600, you think it should be £900, there's some discussion. If you're using a claims management company, we handle this negotiation. If you're claiming yourself, you'll need to counter-offer with justification.

**Weeks 15-20: Settlement** - Once everyone agrees on the compensation amount, the lender processes payment. This typically takes 4-6 weeks—payments go through their finance department, compliance checks, then they issue payment. If you're with us, they pay us, we deduct our fee, and send you your 70%.

### What If It Takes Longer?

Some PCP claims take 6-12 months, and here's usually why:

**The Ombudsman route** - If your lender rejects your claim and you escalate to the Financial Ombudsman Service, add 6-8 months to the timeline. The Ombudsman process is thorough—they review everything independently—but it's not quick. However, it often results in better outcomes. The Ombudsman's decision is binding on your lender, so if they rule in your favor, the lender must pay.

**Multiple PCP agreements** - Claiming on three different PCP deals means three separate assessments. Even if they're with the same lender, each agreement gets reviewed individually. This doesn't triple the timeline, but it does extend it.

**Missing documentation** - If lenders have trouble finding your records (perhaps they acquired another company's book, or records were archived), there can be delays while they dig through old files.

**High claim volumes** - Right now, lenders are receiving thousands of PCP claims. Some have more efficient processes than others. Black Horse and Santander have dedicated teams. Smaller lenders might be slower.

### The FCA Redress Scheme (From May 2026)

Here's something important to understand about timelines: the FCA is launching a systematic redress scheme in May 2026. This scheme will standardize how lenders process PCP claims, potentially making the process faster and more consistent.

Should you wait for the scheme to launch before claiming? No. Here's why: claims submitted now will be processed under the scheme when it launches. You lose nothing by claiming early, but you ensure you're at the front of the queue. The scheme applies retrospectively to existing claims, so you'll benefit from it regardless.

## Are PCP Claims the Same as Car Finance Claims?

This is a great question because the terminology gets used interchangeably, but there are some important distinctions.

Think of it like this: "car finance claims" is the umbrella term. It covers all types of motor finance—PCP, Hire Purchase (HP), personal loans arranged by dealers, conditional sale agreements, the lot. The hidden commission issue affected all of them during 2007-2021.

**PCP claims are a subset of car finance claims**—specifically for Personal Contract Purchase agreements. But here's why PCP claims deserve special attention:

### Why PCP Gets Its Own Category

**PCP was the dominant finance type** during the DCA period. When dealers had the choice, they pushed PCP hard because:
- Lower monthly payments made expensive cars seem affordable (easier to sell)
- Complex structure made commission easier to hide  
- Built-in upgrade cycle meant repeat business (and repeat commission)
- Higher profit margins for both dealers and lenders

By some estimates, PCP represented 60-70% of new car finance deals during the late 2010s. So when we talk about "14 million affected consumers," a huge chunk of them had PCP specifically.

### The Shared Issues

Regardless of whether you had PCP, HP, or a personal loan, if a dealer arranged it between 2007-2021, the core issues are the same:

**Hidden commission** - Dealers earned money by arranging your finance, and most didn't disclose this properly. The commission structure gave them incentive to charge you more, not find you the best deal. Whether you had PCP or HP, this conflict of interest existed.

**Discretionary rate setting** - Under DCAs, dealers could choose your interest rate from a range. Higher rate = higher commission. This applied to all finance types where dealers acted as brokers. Your PCP at 9.9% could've been 7.5%. Someone else's HP at 11.5% could've been 9%. Same issue, different product.

**Lack of informed consent** - The Supreme Court ruled that earning commission by inflating rates required your informed consent. For most consumers, regardless of finance type, that consent was never obtained.

### Where PCP Claims Differ

The main practical difference relates to how the compensation is calculated:

**PCP-specific factors** include the balloon payment structure, early settlement values, and how depreciation was calculated. These technical details affect the math, but the underlying issue—undisclosed, discretionary commission—is identical to other finance types.

If you're wondering "should I be reading about PCP claims specifically, or general car finance claims?" the answer is both. Start with general [car finance claims guidance](/car-finance-claims/car-finance-compensation-guide) to understand the overall scandal, then dive into [PCP-specific details](/car-finance-claims/pcp-claims) (you're here) to understand how it applies to Personal Contract Purchase.

## The FCA Redress Scheme and PCP Claims

In October 2025, the FCA published detailed proposals for an industry-wide motor finance redress scheme. This is a big deal for PCP claims because it creates a standardized, fair process for everyone.

### What the May 2026 Scheme Means for You

Let me explain what's actually going to happen, because there's been some confusion about this scheme.

**The "presumption of harm" rule** - This is the most important part. Under the scheme, if disclosure of commission arrangements was inadequate (and for most PCP deals, it was), there's a presumption you suffered financial loss. The burden shifts: lenders have to prove disclosure was adequate, rather than you having to prove it wasn't. This is huge—it makes claims much easier to succeed.

**Standardized assessment** - Currently, different lenders assess PCP claims differently. Some are generous, others are stingy. From May 2026, they'll all have to follow the same FCA-mandated methodology for calculating compensation. This creates consistency and fairness.

**Systematic processing** - Rather than lenders dealing with claims ad-hoc, the scheme requires systematic processing. They'll have to proactively contact customers, process claims efficiently, and meet deadlines. Think of it like the PPI scandal processing, but with clearer rules from the start.

### Should You Wait or Claim Now?

I get this question constantly: "Should I just wait until May 2026 when the scheme launches?"

My advice: **Claim now.** Here's why:

Claims submitted before May 2026 will be assessed under the scheme once it launches—you don't lose anything by claiming early. In fact, you benefit: you're at the front of the queue when systematic processing begins, your claim is already logged in the system, and you won't risk missing any deadlines.

The scheme isn't a separate claims route—it's a framework that applies to all PCP claims, including ones submitted now. Think of it like rules being clarified for a game that's already being played. Your claim doesn't get invalidated; it gets processed under clearer, fairer rules.

## Making Your PCP Claim: Next Steps

Right, you've read this far, you understand PCP claims, you think you're eligible. What actually happens next?

### Check Your Eligibility (Free, No Obligation)

Whether you claim yourself or use our service, the first step is the same: check if you're actually eligible. For our free eligibility check, we need about 2 minutes of your time and some basic information:

**What we'll ask:**
- When roughly did you get your PCP? (Year is fine, don't need exact dates)
- What car was it? (Make and model)
- Who was the finance company? (If you remember—we can find out if not)
- How did you arrange the finance? (Through dealer or independently?)

**What we'll tell you:**
- Whether you're in the right timeframe (2007-2021)
- If your lender used DCAs
- Realistic assessment of claim strength
- Estimated compensation range (not guaranteed, but based on typical cases)
- What happens next if you want to proceed

No pressure, no obligation. If you're not eligible, we'll tell you honestly and explain why. If you are eligible but want to claim yourself for free, we'll respect that. Our job is to give you accurate information so you can make an informed decision.

### Why Choose Our No Win, No Fee Service?

Let me explain what we actually do and why people choose to use us rather than claiming themselves.

**We know exactly what lenders need** - After handling thousands of PCP claims, we know which evidence strengthens your case, how to present it, and what arguments work. When Close Brothers or Black Horse reviews your claim, it arrives professionally prepared with all the right legal references, evidence, and calculations. This increases success rates.

**We handle the hassle** - You don't chase lenders for responses, you don't decode their legal rejection letters, you don't spend hours on hold trying to speak to their complaints department. We do all that. You just provide initial information, then wait for updates.

**We negotiate aggressively** - If a lender offers £500 and we think you're owed £900, we push back. We've negotiated thousands of these settlements and know what's reasonable. If they won't budge, we escalate to the Ombudsman. You get an experienced negotiator fighting for maximum compensation.

**You risk nothing** - This is genuinely no win, no fee. If your PCP claim fails, you don't pay us anything. Not a penny. We absorb that risk. Only if we successfully recover compensation do we take our 30% + VAT. You keep 70%, which is still better than the zero you'd have if you didn't claim.

### The Alternative: DIY Claims

If you'd rather claim yourself, here's honestly what you're taking on:

You'll need to write formal claim letters, understand the legal basis (Consumer Credit Act 1974, unfair relationships, Supreme Court precedent), request information from lenders, interpret their responses, calculate appropriate compensation amounts, counter-offer if they low-ball you, and potentially take the case to the Financial Ombudsman if rejected.

It's not impossible—consumers have the right to do this for free—but it requires research, time, and persistence. Some people prefer this route because they keep 100% of compensation. Others prefer professional handling because the stress saved is worth the fee.

**Either way, we're here if you need us.** No judgment on which route you choose.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I claim if I've already finished paying my PCP?

Absolutely, yes. Having paid off your PCP makes no difference to eligibility. You're claiming about what happened during the agreement period—specifically, that you weren't properly informed about commission arrangements. Whether you finished paying last month or five years ago, if the PCP ran between 2007-2021, you can claim.

Think of it this way: if someone overcharged you for something in 2018, you don't lose the right to a refund just because you've since paid the bill. The overcharging still happened, and you're still entitled to compensation for it.

### What if I returned the car instead of buying it?

Doesn't matter. Your claim relates to the finance agreement itself—the interest you paid, the commission arrangements, the lack of disclosure. What you did with the car at the end (returned it, bought it with the balloon payment, or traded it in for another PCP) has zero impact on whether you're owed compensation for how the finance was sold.

Many people worry "I didn't keep the car, so how can I claim?" But you did keep the finance payments—you paid them every month for 2-4 years. That's what you're claiming about.

### Can I claim on multiple PCP agreements?

Yes—and this is where compensation can really add up. If you had three PCP deals between 2007-2021 (not uncommon if you were upgrading every few years), you can claim on each one individually.

Each agreement had its own interest rate, its own commission structure, its own overpayments. You don't have to choose which one to claim on—you can claim on all of them. The claims will be assessed separately, but they can be submitted together.

### Will claiming affect my credit score?

No, and this is a really common worry that stops people from claiming. Let me be absolutely clear: making a PCP claim has zero impact on your credit score. You're not applying for credit—you're requesting compensation for potential mis-selling. It's a completely separate process that doesn't touch your credit file.

Even if you currently have active finance with the same lender, claiming for historical PCP arrangements won't affect your credit rating or your current agreements. These are distinct matters.

### What if my lender has gone out of business?

Your claim doesn't disappear just because the lender no longer exists. Finance companies don't just vanish—their loan books get sold to other companies, or they appoint administrators to handle remaining obligations.

We can help identify who now holds your PCP agreement and where to direct your claim. Sometimes this adds a few weeks to the process while we track down the right entity, but it doesn't prevent you from claiming.

### Can I claim if I'm still making PCP payments?

Yes, you absolutely can. Having an active PCP agreement doesn't prevent you from claiming about how it was sold. You're not disputing that you owe the money—you're claiming that you weren't properly informed about commission arrangements when you took it out.

Your payments continue as normal while the claim is assessed. If your claim succeeds, you get compensation for overpayments made to date. The current agreement itself isn't affected.

### What if the dealer was really nice and seemed honest?

This is one of the biggest misconceptions about PCP claims. People think "my dealer seemed trustworthy, so surely they wouldn't have ripped me off?" But here's the reality: most dealers using DCAs weren't deliberately malicious. They were following industry standard practices that seemed normal at the time.

The dealer probably did think they were being helpful. They genuinely might have negotiated with lenders on your behalf. The problem isn't that they were dishonest people—it's that the commission structure incentivized them to charge you more, and this arrangement wasn't properly disclosed. The dealer might not have even fully understood they were mis-selling; they were just doing what everyone else in the industry was doing.

That's why this became such a huge scandal—it was systematic, industry-wide, and normalized. Your dealer being nice doesn't mean your finance was fair.

### How do I find out who my lender was?

Check old bank statements to see who you were paying monthly. Look for names like Black Horse, Close Brothers, Santander, MotoNovo, BMW Financial Services, etc. If you used mobile banking, scroll back through old statements. Your lender name will appear on every monthly payment.

Can't find statements? Check your credit report (free from Experian, Equifax, or ClearScore). Historic credit agreements show up there, often with the lender name and agreement dates.

Still stuck? We can help track down your lender using your vehicle registration number and approximate dates. Lenders keep comprehensive records—we just need to figure out who to ask.

### What evidence do I need to make a PCP claim?

Here's the good news: you need less than you think. At minimum, we need:
- Your name and contact details
- Approximate dates of your PCP (year is fine)
- Vehicle make and model (or registration if you have it)

That's genuinely enough to start. Everything else—your finance agreement, disclosure documents, commission records—that's all held by the lender. We request it from them as part of the claims process.

Many people don't claim because they think "I've lost all my paperwork." You don't need it. The lender has everything on file.

      question: "What is a PCP claim?",
      answer: "A PCP claim is a compensation claim for mis-sold Personal Contract Purchase finance, typically involving hidden commission arrangements where car dealers earned money from your finance agreement without properly disclosing it to you. If you had PCP between 2007-2021, you could be eligible."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I claim on PCP finance?",
      answer: "You may be eligible if you took out PCP finance between 2007 and 2021, bought from a dealership, the dealer arranged the finance, and commission arrangements weren't properly disclosed. Most PCP customers during this period weren't told about dealer commission, making them eligible to claim."
    },
    {
      question: "How much can I get from a PCP claim?",
      answer: "The FCA estimates the average payout at approximately £700 per agreement industry-wide. However, your actual compensation depends on your interest rate, agreement length, finance amount, and specific circumstances. Some claims are worth £200, others £2,000+. Multiple PCP agreements mean you can claim on each."
    },
    {
      question: "Are PCP claims the same as car finance claims?",
      answer: "PCP claims are a type of car finance claim. They share the same hidden commission issues as other finance types (HP, personal loans), but PCP was the most popular finance type from 2007-2021, affecting more consumers. The underlying issue—undisclosed discretionary commission—is the same across all car finance types."
    },
    {
      question: "How long do PCP claims take?",
      answer: "Most PCP claims take 3-5 months from start to finish. Direct lender claims typically take 3-4 months. Claims via management companies average 4-5 months. If escalated to the Financial Ombudsman, the process can take 6-12 months. The FCA redress scheme launching May 2026 may streamline future processing."
