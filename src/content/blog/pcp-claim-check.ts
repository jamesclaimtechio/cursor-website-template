You've been hearing about PCP claims, maybe you've read about the hidden commission scandal, and now you're thinking: "Does this actually apply to me?" You don't want to waste time researching if you're not even eligible. You just want a straight answer: can you claim or not?

Good news: checking your PCP claim eligibility takes about 2 minutes, and I'm going to walk you through exactly how to do it—whether you check with us or figure it out yourself.

## How Do I Check If I Can Claim PCP?

Let's start with the quickest way to get your answer: a simple eligibility check. No complicated forms, no long questionnaires—just a few basic questions that determine if you're in or out.

:::definition PCP Claim Check
A PCP claim check verifies whether your Personal Contract Purchase finance meets the eligibility criteria for hidden commission claims. It confirms your agreement timeframe, lender type, and disclosure status to determine if you can claim compensation.
:::

Here's what you're actually checking when you do a PCP claim check. I'll explain each factor so you understand not just what the answer is, but why it matters:

### The 4 Essential Questions

**Question 1: When was your PCP?**

This is the most important question. PCP claims relate to Discretionary Commission Arrangements (DCAs) that existed between 2007 and 2021. If your PCP started within this window, you're potentially eligible. Outside this window? You're almost certainly not.

**Why the specific dates matter:** DCAs weren't used widely before 2007. The FCA banned them in January 2021. Your PCP needs to have started during the period when these arrangements were legal (though ethically questionable). Even if you finished paying in 2024, if the PCP started in 2019, you're in scope.

**Quick check:** Look at old bank statements, emails, or paperwork. Find when your first PCP payment was made. That's your start date. Anywhere from 2007 to 2021? You've passed question one.

**Question 2: Did a dealer arrange your PCP?**

This determines whether anyone acted as a broker who could've earned commission. If you independently applied to a bank and used that money to buy a car privately, there's no dealer commission to claim. But if a car dealership "sorted the finance" for you, they were acting as a broker.

**Why this matters:** Commission arrangements only exist when someone arranges finance for you and gets paid by the lender for doing so. The dealer is that someone. Even if your paperwork said "Black Horse Finance" or "Santander," if the dealer arranged it, they were the broker earning commission.

**Quick check:** Think about where you bought the car. Car dealership? Car supermarket? Manufacturer-approved used car site? If yes to any of these, and they handled your PCP application, you've passed question two.

**Question 3: What was the lender?**

Not all lenders used DCAs equally during 2007-2021. Some had more aggressive discretionary structures than others. Knowing your lender helps assess claim strength.

**Major lenders who used DCAs:** Black Horse, Close Brothers, Santander, MotoNovo, Moneybarn, Barclays Partner Finance, and many others. If your PCP was with any of these during 2007-2021, DCAs were almost certainly involved.

**Why this matters:** It helps us (or you, if claiming yourself) understand what commission structures existed for your specific PCP, what disclosure standards that lender typically had, and what similar claims have achieved.

**Quick check:** Look at bank statements for who you paid monthly. That's your lender. Google "[lender name] DCA claims" and you'll immediately find whether they're part of the scandal. Chances are, they are.

**Question 4: Were you told about commission arrangements?**

This is the crux of the PCP claim check. Be honest about what you remember: did the dealer sit you down and explain they'd earn more money if your interest rate was higher?

**Why complete honesty matters here:** If you genuinely were told about discretionary commission arrangements and gave informed consent, your claim is weak. But for most people, this conversation never happened. At most, there might've been a buried sentence in paperwork about "potential commission." That's not informed consent—that's inadequate disclosure.

**Quick check:** Think carefully about your finance conversation. Do you remember the dealer explaining: "I can give you rates from 7% to 12%, and I'll earn more commission if I choose a higher rate"? If you're thinking "absolutely not, nothing like that was ever said," you've passed question four.

:::keytakeaway The 2-Minute Verdict
If you answered: (1) PCP between 2007-2021, (2) Dealer arranged it, (3) Major lender, (4) No proper commission disclosure—you're almost certainly eligible to claim. That's your PCP claim check result. You can stop researching and start claiming.

## What Happens When You Check Your PCP Claim?

Let me explain what actually occurs during a PCP claim check, because understanding the process removes the mystery and helps you feel confident about checking.

### If You Check With Us (Free)

**Step 1: Basic information** - We ask the four questions above. Takes literally 2 minutes. You can do it on your phone while waiting for a coffee. No long forms, no complicated details needed.

**Step 2: Instant initial assessment** - Based on your answers, we immediately tell you: eligible or not eligible. If not eligible, we explain honestly why (maybe your PCP was after 2021, or you arranged finance independently). If eligible, we move to step 3.

**Step 3: Claim strength assessment** - We dig slightly deeper. Who was your lender? What vehicle? This helps us assess whether your claim is strong (very likely to succeed), moderate (worth pursuing but not guaranteed), or weak (technically eligible but challenging).

**Step 4: Realistic compensation estimate** - Based on thousands of similar PCP cases, we give you an estimated range. Not a promise—we can't guarantee amounts until your case is investigated properly—but an informed estimate based on typical payouts for similar agreements.

**Step 5: Your decision** - We explain both options: claim yourself (free, keep 100%) or use our service (no win no fee, keep 70%). No pressure whatsoever. Many people do the check, realize they're eligible, then claim themselves. We're fine with that. Our goal at the check stage is just information.

**Total time: 2 minutes for basic check, 5 minutes if you want detailed discussion.**

### If You Check Yourself

You can absolutely do your own PCP claim check without any company's help. Here's how:

**Check your dates:** Pull up old bank statements or emails. Find when your PCP started. Between 2007-2021? Tick.

**Check your lender:** Who did you pay monthly? Google "[that lender] DCA claims" or "[that lender] commission claims." If results appear, they used DCAs. Tick.

**Check your arrangement:** Did a dealer arrange the PCP? Not a private sale, not independent bank application? Tick.

**Check your memory:** Were you told about dealer commission and rate discretion? If not, tick.

**Four ticks?** You're eligible. That's your PCP claim check complete. No company needed to tell you that.

The difference between checking yourself vs checking with us isn't the eligibility outcome—it's what happens after. If you check yourself, you then start the claims process yourself. If you check with us, we can start the process for you immediately if you want. Same eligibility result, different paths forward.

## Common PCP Claim Check Questions

### How accurate are PCP claim checks?

Let me be honest about this: an initial eligibility check based on basic information (dates, lender, circumstances) is highly accurate for determining *whether you can claim*, but less accurate for predicting *how much you'll get*.

**The eligibility part is straightforward:** You either had PCP during 2007-2021 with a dealer-arranged, DCA-using lender, or you didn't. That's factual, binary, and an eligibility check answers it definitively.

**The compensation part is trickier:** Until your specific PCP agreement is reviewed, commission records pulled, and calculations done, any compensation estimate is educated guesswork based on similar cases. We might say "typically £600-900 for this scenario," and you might get £750. But you might get £550 or £1,100 depending on factors we can't see until full investigation.

**Think of it like this:** The PCP claim check tells you if you're in the game. It doesn't tell you exactly what prize you'll win—that requires playing the game (making the actual claim).

### What information do I need for a PCP claim check?

Bare minimum:
- Approximate year your PCP started (2016? 2018?)
- Type of car (BMW? Ford? Even just "medium-sized car" helps)
- Vague idea of who financed it (if you remember)

**That's honestly it for initial check.** You don't need:
- Exact dates (year is fine)
- Agreement numbers
- Paperwork or documents
- Payment records
- Precise financial details

The initial PCP claim check is about qualifying factors (dates, lender type, arrangement method), not about precise calculations. Precision comes later if you proceed with an actual claim.

### Can I check multiple PCP agreements at once?

Yes, and you should if you had more than one. Many people had several PCP deals between 2007-2021—maybe you upgraded every 3 years, which was exactly what PCP was designed for.

**Here's what we typically see:**
- 2014: First PCP (maybe a VW Golf)
- 2017: Second PCP (upgraded to an Audi)
- 2020: Third PCP (upgraded to something else)

Each one is a separate potential claim. When you do your PCP claim check, tell us (or note for yourself) about all agreements. Each gets checked individually. Three eligible agreements could mean three compensation payments.

### What if I can't remember my PCP details?

This is incredibly common. You bought a car 7 years ago—of course you don't remember exact dates or lender names. That's completely normal and doesn't prevent you checking.

**What usually works:**
- Check old email for car purchase confirmations (lender often mentioned)
- Look at bank statement archives for car payments (lender name appears)
- Check your credit report (shows historical credit agreements)
- Ask the dealership (if they're still operating, they'll have records)

**Still completely stuck?** We can often identify your lender using just your vehicle registration and approximate year. The DVLA and finance records are connected—we can trace backwards from the car to the finance. It takes a few extra days, but it's doable.

### Does checking affect anything?

No—this is just checking. Checking your PCP claim eligibility doesn't:
- ❌ Affect your credit score
- ❌ Alert your lender
- ❌ Start any formal process
- ❌ Commit you to claiming
- ❌ Cost anything
- ❌ Obligate you in any way

You're literally just answering "am I eligible?" That's information gathering, nothing more. What you do with that information—claim yourself, use our service, or do nothing—is entirely up to you.

### What happens if I'm not eligible?

We tell you honestly why, and that's the end of it. No pressure to claim anyway, no suggesting you might be eligible for "other claims," no sales pitch. Just: "Your PCP was after 2021, so DCAs don't apply. You're not eligible for this type of claim."

Some people appreciate knowing definitively they're not eligible—it stops them worrying about missing out. Others are disappointed but at least they know. Either way, checking gives you certainty.

### What if I'm eligible but not sure I want to claim?

That's completely fine. The PCP claim check just tells you if you *can* claim. Whether you *should* claim is a different question that only you can answer based on your circumstances.

**Reasons people check but don't proceed:**
- Time isn't right (dealing with other priorities)
- Want to research more first
- Prefer to wait for FCA scheme in May 2026 (though we recommend claiming now)
- Happy to know but not motivated by the compensation amount
- Philosophical reasons (don't believe in claims culture)

**All valid.** The check gives you information. What you do with it is your choice.

## How to Check Your PCP Eligibility (Step by Step)

Let me give you a complete walkthrough of checking your PCP claim eligibility yourself, because transparency is important—you should know exactly what we're checking when you use our service.

### DIY PCP Claim Check (5 Minutes)

**Step 1: Find when your PCP started**

Go to your online banking (or paper statements if you're old school like that). Search for car finance payments. Look for payments to Black Horse, Close Brothers, Santander, MotoNovo, or similar lenders.

Find the first payment date. That's when your PCP started. Make a note: "PCP started [month] [year]."

**Is it between January 2007 and December 2021?**
- Yes → Continue to step 2
- No → You're not eligible for DCA claims (stop here)

**Step 2: Identify your lender**

Look at who you were paying. The company name on your bank statements is your lender.

**Google "[lender name] car finance DCA claims"**

Do results appear about hidden commission, DCAs, claims? 
- Yes → Your lender used DCAs (continue to step 3)
- No results → Either niche lender or didn't use DCAs (investigate further)

**Step 3: Confirm arrangement method**

Think back to buying the car. Did you:
- (A) Buy from a dealership who "sorted the finance"
- (B) Apply to a bank yourself, get approved independently, then use that money to buy a car

If (A) → Dealer arranged it (continue to step 4)  
If (B) → No dealer commission (you're not eligible)

**Step 4: Assess disclosure**

Honestly ask yourself: "Was I told the dealer could adjust my interest rate and would earn more by setting it higher?"

- No, definitely not → Strong claim (you're eligible!)
- Vaguely mentioned commission → Moderate claim (still eligible, disclosure likely inadequate)
- Yes, clearly explained → Weak claim (proper disclosure may have occurred)

**If you've reached this step with mostly "yes" answers, you're eligible for a PCP claim.** That's your DIY check complete.

### Our Free PCP Claim Check (2 Minutes)

**What we ask:**
1. "When roughly did you have PCP?" → Checking date eligibility
2. "What car was it?" → Helps identify lender if unknown
3. "Who financed it?" → Checking lender used DCAs
4. "How was it arranged?" → Checking dealer involvement

**What we tell you:**
- Eligible or not eligible (clear answer)
- Why (explanation of reasoning)
- Claim strength (strong/moderate/weak if eligible)
- Estimated compensation range (based on similar cases)
- What happens next (your two options)

**Time commitment:** Literally 2 minutes. You can do it while waiting for the kettle to boil.

**Obligation:** None. Zero. If you're eligible but want to claim yourself for free, we'll tell you that's absolutely your right and wish you luck.

## What Makes a Strong PCP Claim?

Not all PCP claims are created equal. Some are virtually guaranteed to succeed. Others are more challenging. Let me explain what determines claim strength, because this helps you assess your own situation realistically.

### Strong PCP Claims (Very Likely to Succeed)

Your PCP claim check would show "strong" if your situation matches these:

**Clear timeframe** - PCP started 2007-2021, fully within the DCA period. No borderline dates, no uncertainty. Squarely in the scandal timeframe.

**Major lender** - Black Horse, Close Brothers, Santander, MotoNovo—the big players all used DCAs extensively. Claims against major lenders are well-established with lots of precedent.

**Dealer arrangement** - The dealer clearly handled your PCP finance. You remember them "sorting it out." No question about broker involvement.

**Zero disclosure** - You're absolutely certain commission was never mentioned. No conversations about it, no documents explaining it, nothing. This is the strongest position—complete absence of disclosure.

**Multiple agreements** - You had several PCP deals during 2007-2021. Each one reinforces the pattern of undisclosed commission. Plus, multiple claims mean multiple compensation payments.

**Example of strong claim:**  
"I had Black Horse PCP on a VW Golf from 2016-2020. The dealer at the car supermarket arranged everything. I was never told about commission, let alone that the dealer could adjust my rate. I also had another Black Horse PCP in 2013 on a different car, same dealer, same lack of disclosure."

**This claim would likely succeed easily.** Major lender, clear timeframe, dealer arrangement, no disclosure, multiple agreements. Tick all the boxes.

### Moderate PCP Claims (Worth Pursuing, Success Likely)

Your check might show "moderate" if there are some complicating factors:

**Vague disclosure memory** - You think commission might have been mentioned somewhere, but you definitely weren't told about rate discretion or variable commission amounts. This is partial disclosure, which is still inadequate, but it's not complete absence.

**Less common lender** - Maybe your PCP was with a smaller finance company. They probably used DCAs (it was industry-standard), but there's less established precedent for claims against them specifically.

**Long time ago** - If your PCP was 2007-2010, it's longer ago. Doesn't make you ineligible, but proving what disclosure occurred can be harder with very old agreements.

**Complex arrangement** - Perhaps you had manufacturer finance (BMW Finance, VW Finance) which was underwritten by a third-party lender. The arrangement was more complex, which doesn't prevent claiming, but adds layers to unpick.

**Moderate claims still succeed regularly.** They just might require more evidence, stronger arguments, or negotiation to reach settlement. Don't be discouraged if your check shows "moderate"—it's still worth pursuing.

### Weak PCP Claims (Challenging But Not Impossible)

Some scenarios make claims harder, though not impossible:

**Post-2021 PCP** - If your PCP started after January 2021 (when DCAs were banned), discretionary commission shouldn't exist. You might still have grounds for other mis-selling issues, but the main DCA claim doesn't apply.

**Clear disclosure evidence** - If investigation reveals you were properly informed about commission arrangements, gave documented consent, and understood the implications, the claim is very weak. Disclosure defeats the unfairness argument.

**Independent arrangement** - If you genuinely arranged PCP independently with a lender (no dealer involvement), there's no broker commission to claim. Direct-to-consumer PCP doesn't have the same commission structures.

**0% APR deals** - Genuine 0% manufacturer promotional finance doesn't have interest to manipulate or commission to hide. If you had true 0% finance with proper disclosure, claims are unlikely to succeed.

**Weak doesn't mean impossible**, but it means you should know going in that success is less certain. Might still be worth checking thoroughly, but set appropriate expectations.

## PCP Claim Check Results: What They Mean

When you complete a PCP claim check (with us or yourself), you'll get a result. Let me explain what each possible outcome actually means:

### "You're Eligible" - Now What?

This means you've met the basic criteria: PCP during 2007-2021, dealer-arranged, lender used DCAs, disclosure was likely inadequate. You can proceed with a claim.

**Your options from here:**

**Option A: Claim yourself** - You've confirmed eligibility, now you can write to your PCP lender directly. No cost, but you handle everything yourself. Many people do this successfully.

**Option B: Use claims management** - You've confirmed eligibility, we handle the actual claim professionally. No win no fee basis, you pay only if compensation is recovered.

**Option C: Do more research** - You know you're eligible, but you want to read more, understand better, or wait for the right time. That's fine—eligibility doesn't expire immediately (though don't wait years).

**The check has done its job:** given you information to make an informed decision.

### "You're Not Eligible" - Understanding Why

This means you don't meet the basic criteria for PCP commission claims. Let me explain the common reasons:

**PCP after 2021** - Your agreement started after the DCA ban. Discretionary commission shouldn't apply to post-ban agreements with proper disclosure.

**Not PCP** - Maybe what you thought was PCP was actually HP or a personal loan. Different product, though you might still have a claim—just not specifically a PCP claim.

**No dealer involvement** - You arranged finance independently through your bank. No dealer broker = no dealer commission to claim.

**Already claimed successfully** - You've already received compensation for this specific PCP. You can't claim twice on the same agreement.

**If you're not eligible for PCP claims specifically, you might still be eligible for other types of car finance claims.** The [broader car finance claims guide](/car-finance-claims/car-finance-compensation-guide) covers other claim types you might qualify for.

### "Moderate Claim" - What This Means

This result means you're technically eligible, but there are factors that make success less certain:

**Partial disclosure** - Some mention of commission might have occurred, making the "inadequate disclosure" argument weaker (though potentially still valid).

**Unusual circumstances** - Maybe your PCP structure was non-standard, or your credit situation was complex. Not disqualifying, but requires more careful assessment.

**Less common lender** - Your lender used DCAs but they're smaller/less known, so there's less precedent for claims against them specifically.

**Moderate claims are still worth pursuing**—success rates are good—but you should know the outcome is less certain than "strong" claims. Whether to proceed depends on your risk tolerance and how much effort you want to invest.

## Checking Your PCP Claim: Common Mistakes

Let me warn you about mistakes people make when checking PCP eligibility, because avoiding these saves time and frustration:

### Mistake 1: Giving Up Too Easily

**"I can't remember anything about my PCP, so I can't check"**

You'd be amazed how much information exists even when you think you remember nothing. Bank statements from 2017 still exist in your online banking. Your credit report shows historical agreements. The DVLA has vehicle finance records. Email archives contain car purchase confirmations.

People give up thinking "I don't have information," when actually information is retrievable with 10 minutes of searching. Check old statements before assuming you can't proceed.

### Mistake 2: Confusing Finance Types

**"I had car finance, so I must be eligible for PCP claims"**

Not all car finance is PCP. Hire Purchase (HP) is different. Personal loans are different. Conditional Sale is different. PCP specifically involves lower monthly payments and a final balloon payment with option to return the car.

If you don't actually know what type you had, check paperwork or statements. "PCP" or "Personal Contract Purchase" should appear if it was PCP. If it says "Hire Purchase" or "HP," you have a claim—just not specifically a PCP claim.

### Mistake 3: Wrong Timeframes

**"My PCP finished in 2023, so I'm too late"**

The relevant date is when your PCP *started*, not when it finished. A PCP that started in 2019 and finished in 2023 is fully eligible because it started during the DCA period (2007-2021). Even if you finished paying recently, if the agreement originated during the scandal years, you can claim.

### Mistake 4: Assuming 0% Finance Is Claimable

**"I had 0% PCP, so I can claim"**

Genuine 0% finance typically doesn't have hidden commission issues because there's no interest to inflate. If you had true 0% APR (check your paperwork), this usually means manufacturer promotional finance with no broker commission structure.

However, some "0% deals" weren't truly 0%—they had balloon payments that included interest, or they had arrangement fees that functioned like interest. Worth checking, but genuine 0% deals are usually not claimable for commission.

### Mistake 5: Thinking Small Amounts Aren't Worth It

**"£300 compensation isn't worth the hassle"**

Two things about this: First, you don't know it's £300 until you claim—it might be £800. Initial estimates are rough. Second, £300 is still £300 you didn't have before. Is it worth 2 minutes to check? Is it worth letting us handle it (no win no fee) if you're eligible?

Some people undervalue their claims and don't bother. Then they hear someone got £1,200 and kick themselves. At least check—you can decide whether to proceed once you know the potential amount.

## Making Your PCP Claim After Checking

You've done your PCP claim check, you're eligible, now you're wondering what actually happens next. Let me walk through the immediate next steps:

### If You're Using Our Service

**Immediate next steps (if you want to proceed):**

We've already got your basic information from the eligibility check. Now we need slightly more detail:
- Full name and contact details
- Vehicle registration number (if available)
- Any paperwork you do have (helpful but not essential)

**We then:**
- Request your full PCP agreement from the lender under data protection law
- Pull commission records
- Review disclosure documents
- Calculate your specific overpayment
- Prepare comprehensive claim
- Submit to your lender

**Your involvement:** Minimal. Maybe we call with a follow-up question or two. Otherwise, we update you at key milestones (claim submitted, lender responded, offer received, settlement agreed).

**Timeline from check to claim:** Usually 1-2 weeks to gather documentation, then we submit. The 8-week lender response clock starts from submission.

### If You're Claiming Yourself

**Immediate next steps:**

**Get your PCP agreement** - Write to your lender requesting a copy under data protection law (they have to provide it within 30 days, usually free or small admin fee).

**Research commission structures** - Find out what discretionary arrangements your lender used during your PCP period. Industry reports, FCA documents, and other claimants' experiences help here.

**Draft your claim letter** - Explain you're claiming for undisclosed commission, reference Consumer Credit Act 1974 Section 140A-140C (unfair relationships), cite Supreme Court August 2025 ruling, request commission records, ask for compensation calculation.

**Submit to lender** - Send by recorded delivery or email (get proof of submission). The 8-week response clock starts from when they receive it.

**Our [full PCP claims guide](/car-finance-claims/pcp-claims) has detailed DIY claiming instructions** if you want step-by-step guidance for the self-claim route.

## PCP Claim Check: Quick Reference

### Your 60-Second Eligibility Test

Answer these honestly:

**1. PCP between 2007-2021?** □ Yes □ No  
**2. Dealer arranged it?** □ Yes □ No  
**3. Commission not disclosed?** □ Yes □ No  

**3 x Yes?** → You're eligible. Stop researching, start claiming.  
**Any No?** → Check why (wrong dates? wrong finance type? independent arrangement?)

### What Affects Your Compensation

**Higher compensation:**
- Longer PCP term (4-5 years)
- Expensive car (£20,000+)
- High interest rate (10%+ APR)
- Multiple PCP agreements
- Recent (more statutory interest)

**Lower compensation:**
- Shorter term (2-3 years)
- Cheaper car (under £15,000)
- Lower interest rate (under 8%)
- Single agreement
- Long ago (less statutory interest)

**Most important:** Even "low" compensation is still money you're owed. Don't dismiss a £400 claim because it's not £1,000. It's £400 you didn't have before.

### Next Steps After Checking

**If eligible:**
1. Decide: claim yourself or use professional service
2. Gather: vehicle details, approximate dates, lender name
3. Start: claim process (takes 3-5 months typically)

**If not eligible:**
- Understand why
- Check if other claim types apply
- At least you know definitively

Answer these 4 questions and you'll know if you're eligible. The check takes 2 minutes and requires no paperwork—just basic information about your PCP dates and lender."

      question: "What information do I need for a PCP claim check?",
      answer: "You need: approximate year your PCP started, type of car (or registration), and lender name if you remember. That's it for initial eligibility checking. You don't need exact dates, agreement numbers, or paperwork—just basic information to determine if you meet qualifying criteria."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I check multiple PCP agreements at once?",
      answer: "Yes. If you had several PCP deals between 2007-2021, check each one. Each agreement is assessed separately and could result in separate compensation. Three eligible PCP agreements could mean three claims totaling significantly more than single-agreement compensation."
    },
    {
      question: "Does checking my PCP eligibility affect anything?",
      answer: "No. Checking is just information gathering. It doesn't affect your credit score, alert your lender, start formal processes, or commit you to claiming. You're simply finding out if you're eligible. What you do with that information is entirely your choice."
    },
    {
      question: "What if my PCP claim check shows I'm eligible?",
      answer: "You have two options: claim yourself (free, keep 100% of compensation) or use a claims management company (no win no fee, professional handling, keep 70%). Neither option is wrong—it depends on whether you value time saved or fee saved. The check has confirmed you can claim; how you proceed is your choice."
