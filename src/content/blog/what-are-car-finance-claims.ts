## What Are Car Finance Claims?

:::definition Car Finance Claims
Claims for compensation relating to hidden commission arrangements where car dealers and brokers earned money from your finance agreement without properly disclosing it to you.
:::

Car finance claims relate to hidden commission arrangements where car dealers and brokers earned money from your finance agreement without properly disclosing it to you.

Between 2007 and 2024, many car finance agreements included [Discretionary Commission Arrangements (DCAs)](/car-finance-claims/understanding-discretionary-commission-arrangements) that allowed brokers to increase your interest rate to earn higher commission—creating a clear conflict of interest.

## Why Are People Claiming?

:::keytakeaway The Core Issues
The [Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)](https://www.fca.org.uk/) found widespread issues with how car finance was sold. Dealers were incentivized to charge you more, not get you the best deal - and most customers had no idea this was happening.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found widespread issues with how car finance was sold, including:

- **Hidden Commission**: Dealers received commission without disclosing it to customers
- **Inflated Interest Rates**: DCAs allowed brokers to increase rates for higher commission
- **Lack of Disclosure**: Consumers weren't informed about commission structures
- **Conflict of Interest**: Brokers were incentivized to charge you more, not get you the best deal

## How Many People Are Affected?

According to the FCA, up to **14 million UK consumers** who purchased vehicles using finance between 2007 and 2024 may have been affected. This represents one of the largest consumer redress cases in UK history.

:::warning Important Deadline
The FCA redress scheme launches in **May 2026**. Getting your claim in early helps ensure you're at the front of the queue when systematic processing begins. Read our [FCA redress scheme guide](/car-finance-claims/fca-redress-scheme-2026) for complete details.

## The FCA Redress Scheme

The FCA has proposed an industry-wide redress scheme launching in **May 2026**. This scheme will:

- Establish a presumption of harm for inadequate disclosure
- Set out clear methodologies for calculating compensation
- Require lenders to process claims systematically
- Provide consumers with clear routes to compensation

## What Can You Claim For?

There are two main types of car finance claims:

### 1. DCA Claims (Discretionary Commission Arrangements)

:::highlight[blue] What Are DCAs?
These claims relate to arrangements where your broker could increase your interest rate to earn higher commission. DCAs were banned by the FCA in January 2021 - but if you had finance before then, you may be owed compensation. Learn more about [understanding DCAs](/car-finance-claims/understanding-discretionary-commission-arrangements). If you had a PCP agreement, check our [PCP claims guide](/car-finance-claims/pcp-claims).
:::

### 2. Irresponsible Lending Claims

:::highlight[amber] Affordability Issues
These claims relate to situations where you were sold finance without proper affordability checks, or where the lender should have known the finance was unaffordable for you.
