Discretionary Commission Arrangements (DCAs) are at the heart of the car finance scandal affecting millions of UK consumers. Here's what you need to know. For a complete overview of all claim types, see our [car finance compensation guide](/car-finance-claims/car-finance-compensation-guide).

## What Were DCAs?

:::definition DCA (Discretionary Commission Arrangement)
A commission structure that allowed car dealers and brokers to increase your interest rate to earn higher commission - without telling you. The more they charged you, the more they earned.
:::

Discretionary Commission Arrangements were commission structures that allowed car dealers and brokers to adjust your interest rate to increase their earnings.

:::keytakeaway The Core Problem
The key feature of DCAs: **the higher the dealer set your interest rate, the more commission they earned**. This created a fundamental conflict of interest - your broker was incentivised to charge you more, not find you the best deal.
:::

## How Did DCAs Work?

Here's how the process typically worked:

:::steps How DCAs Inflated Your Interest Rate
1. Lender sets a minimum interest rate they'd accept for your loan
2. Your broker or dealer increases that rate—sometimes by several percentage points—to boost their commission
3. You end up paying the inflated rate without being told about the arrangement
:::

## Why Were DCAs Problematic?

:::proscons Why DCAs Were Harmful
pros:
- Easy finance approval process for consumers
- Dealers had flexibility in structuring deals
cons:
- Brokers incentivised to charge you more, not find best deals
- Most consumers had no idea their rate was inflated
- No disclosure of commission arrangements
- Supreme Court ruled it created "unfair relationships"
:::

### The Supreme Court Ruling

The Supreme Court ruled in August 2025 that certain arrangements constituted an "unfair relationship" under the [Consumer Credit Act 1974](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/consumer-credit-act) - a landmark decision that opened the door for compensation claims.

## When Were DCAs Used?

DCAs were widely used in the car finance industry from approximately **2007 until they were banned in January 2021**.

:::warning Important Deadline
The FCA redress scheme launches in **May 2026**. If you had car finance between 2007-2021, you should check your eligibility now to be at the front of the queue. Learn more about the [FCA redress scheme](/car-finance-claims/fca-redress-scheme-2026).

## The FCA's Action

:::timeline FCA Response to DCAs
Initial Review: 2017-2019 - [FCA](https://www.fca.org.uk/) market study identified concerns
DCA Ban: January 2021 - Brokers can no longer adjust rates
Court Ruling: August 2025 - Supreme Court confirms unfair relationships
Redress Scheme: May 2026 - Compensation scheme launches
:::

## How Much Were Brokers Earning?

While commission levels varied, brokers could earn significant amounts:

- Commission was often a percentage of the total interest paid
- Higher interest rates = more total interest = more commission
- Some arrangements paid thousands of pounds per vehicle

:::example Typical DCA Impact
If your broker increased your interest rate by just 2%, on a £15,000 car loan over 4 years:
- Extra interest paid: approximately £1,200-£1,500
- Broker commission from this increase: £300-£500+
- You paid more, broker earned more, lender was indifferent
:::

## Am I Affected by DCAs?

:::checklist You May Be Eligible to Claim If:
- Had car finance between 2007-2021
- Were not told about commission arrangements
- Were not given the opportunity to negotiate your interest rate

The FCA redress scheme launching in May 2026 will:

- Provide clear routes for consumers to claim

      question: "What's the difference between a DCA and a fixed commission?",
      answer: "With a fixed commission, the broker earned the same amount regardless of your interest rate. With a DCA, the broker could increase your rate to earn more commission—creating an incentive to charge you more. DCAs were banned in January 2021 due to this conflict of interest."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know if my finance had a DCA?",
      answer: "Most consumers weren't told about DCAs at the time. If you had car finance between 2007-2021 and weren't explicitly informed about how the broker's commission was calculated, your agreement may have included a DCA. We can help you check by locating your original agreement."

    {
      question: "Why were DCAs banned by the FCA?",
      answer: "The FCA banned DCAs in January 2021 because they created a fundamental conflict of interest. Brokers were incentivised to charge customers more rather than find them the best deal. The Supreme Court later ruled in August 2025 that certain DCA arrangements constituted an 'unfair relationship' under consumer credit law."
