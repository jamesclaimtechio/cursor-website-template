Car finance compensation has become a significant consumer issue in the UK, with millions of agreements potentially affected by undisclosed commission arrangements and other practices. This comprehensive guide explains the different types of compensation claims, eligibility criteria, and the process for pursuing claims. If you're specifically interested in [PCP claims](/car-finance-claims/pcp-claims) or [mis-sold car finance](/car-finance-claims/mis-sold-car-finance-claim), we have dedicated guides for those topics.

## Understanding UK Car Finance Agreements

Before exploring compensation claims, it's important to understand how car finance works in the UK and the scale of the market.

### The UK Car Finance Market

:::keytakeaway A Major Consumer Issue
The UK car finance market represents a substantial sector of consumer lending. In recent years, the majority of new cars have been purchased using finance rather than cash, making motor finance a significant part of many household budgets - and the commission scandal affects millions.
:::

Finance agreements allow consumers to spread the cost of vehicle purchases over time, making cars more accessible. However, the complexity of these agreements and commission arrangements has led to widespread regulatory concerns.

### Common Types of Car Finance Agreements

**Personal Contract Purchase (PCP)**

PCP is a popular form of car finance that works as follows (read our detailed [PCP claims guide](/car-finance-claims/pcp-claims) for more information):

1. **Initial Deposit:** You pay an upfront deposit, typically 10% of the car's value
2. **Monthly Payments:** Regular payments over a set term (usually 24-48 months)
3. **End Options:** At term end, you can:
   - Pay a final balloon payment to own the car
   - Return the car and walk away (subject to mileage and condition)
   - Trade the car for a new PCP agreement

**Key Features:**
- Lower monthly payments than traditional loans
- Mileage restrictions apply
- Car condition requirements
- Balloon payment can be substantial

**Hire Purchase (HP)**

Hire Purchase is a more straightforward arrangement:

1. **Deposit:** Upfront payment (typically 10-20%)
2. **Fixed Monthly Payments:** Regular payments over the agreement term
3. **Ownership:** The car becomes yours after the final payment

**Key Features:**
- Straightforward ownership path
- Fixed payments throughout term
- No balloon payment
- No mileage restrictions

### Why Agreement Type Matters for Claims

The type of finance agreement affects how compensation is calculated and which issues may apply. PCP agreements often involve more complex commission structures due to balloon payments and guaranteed minimum future values.

## Types of Car Finance Compensation Claims

Several distinct types of claims may apply to car finance agreements.

### Discretionary Commission Arrangement (DCA) Claims

:::definition DCA (Discretionary Commission Arrangement)
Commission structures that allowed car dealers and brokers to increase customer interest rates to earn higher commission. Banned by the FCA on 28 January 2021. Learn more about [how DCAs worked](/car-finance-claims/understanding-discretionary-commission-arrangements) in our detailed guide.
:::

**How DCAs Worked:**

:::steps The DCA Process
1. Lenders set a base interest rate for customers
2. Dealers could increase this rate within certain limits
3. Higher rates meant higher dealer commission
4. Customers were rarely informed about this practice
:::

:::warning The Conflict of Interest
This created a fundamental conflict of interest. Dealers were incentivized to charge customers higher rates, not to secure the best deal for them - and most customers had no idea this was happening.
:::

:::infobox[blue] FCA Redress Scheme Coming
The FCA is conducting a comprehensive investigation into DCAs, with a redress scheme launching in May 2026. Until the scheme launches with published methodologies, the exact approach to DCA compensation remains pending. Read our complete [FCA redress scheme guide](/car-finance-claims/fca-redress-scheme-2026) for detailed information.
:::

### Commission Disclosure Claims

Following the Supreme Court ruling in August 2025, claims may be valid where commission arrangements were not adequately disclosed to customers, even without DCAs being involved.

**Key Principles:**

**Informed Consent:** Customers should have been informed about commission arrangements and given the opportunity to consent.

**Unfair Relationships:** Where disclosure was inadequate, the relationship may be deemed "unfair" under the Consumer Credit Act 1974.

**Presumption of Harm:** If disclosure was inadequate, there's a presumption customers suffered loss unless lenders can prove otherwise.

**Available Remedies:**

- Return of undisclosed commission plus statutory interest
- APR adjustment to reflect what should have been paid
- Additional compensation in some circumstances

### Irresponsible Lending Claims

Irresponsible lending claims arise when finance was provided without adequate affordability assessments.

**What Constitutes Irresponsible Lending:**

**Inadequate Income Checks:** The lender didn't properly verify your income.

**Insufficient Expenditure Assessment:** Your regular outgoings weren't adequately considered.

**Poor Credit History Review:** Previous credit issues weren't properly evaluated.

**Lack of Affordability Assessment:** No proper assessment of whether you could afford the repayments.

**Circumstances Indicating Irresponsible Lending:**

- You were struggling financially when the agreement was taken out
- The repayments were clearly unaffordable based on your circumstances
- The lender didn't request proper income or expenditure information
- You had significant existing debts that weren't considered
- The agreement led to immediate financial difficulties

**Assessment Requirements:**

Determining irresponsible lending requires reviewing your financial circumstances at the time the agreement was made. This typically involves:

- Bank statements from the relevant period
- Income documentation
- Records of existing credit commitments
- Evidence of financial difficulties

### Other Commission-Related Issues

Beyond DCAs, other commission arrangements may give rise to claims:

**Volume Commissions:** Where dealers received bonuses for selling certain volumes of finance, potentially incentivizing sales over customer interests.

**Manufacturer Bonuses:** Additional payments from manufacturers for selling finance through particular lenders.

**Undisclosed Incentives:** Any financial incentives not properly disclosed that may have influenced the advice or options presented.

## Eligibility for Car Finance Compensation Claims

Understanding eligibility criteria helps you assess whether pursuing a claim may be worthwhile.

## Current Regulatory Status: The FCA Investigation

The FCA's ongoing investigation significantly affects car finance compensation claims.

### The FCA's Motor Finance Investigation

**Timeline:**

**2019:** The [Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)](https://www.fca.org.uk/) launched initial market study into motor finance practices.

**January 2021:** DCAs banned by the FCA.

**January 2024:** FCA announced comprehensive review of historical DCA use and introduced temporary complaint handling rules.

**October 2025:** FCA published consultation on Motor Finance Consumer Redress Scheme (CP25/27).

**December 2025:** Consultation closed; FCA analyzing responses.

**May 2026:** Redress scheme expected to launch with final methodologies (see our [FCA redress scheme guide](/car-finance-claims/fca-redress-scheme-2026) for full details).

### Temporary Complaint Handling Rules

The FCA introduced temporary rules affecting DCA claims:

**DCA Claims Pause:**
- Lenders may pause responses to DCA complaints
- Pause applies until redress scheme launches (May 2026)
- Allows FCA to establish consistent approach
- Prevents inconsistent outcomes for consumers

**What This Means:**
- DCA claims can still be submitted
- They will be queued for processing
- Resolution will follow FCA's published methodologies
- Ensures fair, consistent treatment across all lenders

**Claims NOT Affected:**
- Irresponsible lending claims continue to be processed
- Commission disclosure claims (non-DCA) proceed normally
- Other consumer credit complaints are unaffected

### The May 2026 Redress Scheme

The forthcoming scheme will establish:

**Standardized Methodologies:** Clear calculation approaches all lenders must follow.

**Presumption of Harm:** Where disclosure was inadequate, consumers are presumed to have suffered loss.

**Two Proposed Remedies:**
1. Commission repayment plus statutory interest
2. APR adjustment remedy

**Rebuttal Provisions:** Lenders can rebut presumption with evidence (e.g., 0% APR deals).

**Escalation Routes:** Clear procedures for disputing calculations and escalating to the Ombudsman.

## Understanding Potential Compensation

While precise amounts depend on individual circumstances and FCA methodologies, understanding the factors and approaches helps set realistic expectations.

### Factors Affecting Compensation Amounts

**Loan Amount:** Larger finance agreements typically involve more interest paid, potentially resulting in higher compensation.

**Interest Rate Differential:** The gap between your rate and what it should have been affects compensation calculations.

**Agreement Term:** Longer terms mean more interest payments, potentially increasing compensation.

**Commission Amount:** The size of undisclosed or improper commission influences calculations.

**Type of Claim:** DCA, disclosure, or irresponsible lending claims use different calculation approaches.

**Statutory Interest:** 8% per year from payment dates can significantly increase total compensation.

### Calculation Approaches

For detailed compensation calculations, see our [car finance compensation calculator guide](/car-finance-claims/car-finance-compensation-calculation).

**For DCA Claims (General Principles):**

The typical approach involves:
1. Calculate interest paid at your actual rate
2. Calculate what would have been paid at base rate (without discretionary element)
3. Refund the difference
4. Add statutory interest (8% per year) from payment dates

**For Commission Disclosure Claims:**

Two potential approaches:
1. **Commission Repayment:** Return of undisclosed commission plus statutory interest
2. **APR Adjustment:** Calculation of fair payments without commission affecting rate, refunding difference plus interest

**For Irresponsible Lending Claims:**

Potential outcomes include:
1. Refund of interest paid
2. Refund of fees and charges
3. In some cases, refund of both interest and fees
4. Plus statutory interest on refunded amounts

### Important Notes About Amounts

**No Guaranteed Amounts:** Each case is assessed individually based on specific circumstances and available evidence.

**FCA Methodologies Pending:** Final calculation approaches will be published with the May 2026 redress scheme.

**Individual Variation:** Similar agreements may result in different compensation based on individual factors.

**Statutory Interest Matters:** Don't overlook the 8% statutory interest component, which can substantially increase total compensation.

## Making Claims for Multiple Vehicles

If you've had multiple car finance agreements, you may be able to claim for each one.

### Multiple Claims Considerations

**Each Agreement Assessed Independently:** Every finance agreement is evaluated on its own merits.

**Different Claim Types Possible:** One agreement might involve DCAs while another involves irresponsible lending.

**Documentation Required for Each:** You'll need paperwork for every agreement you're claiming for.

**Different Outcomes Possible:** Success with one claim doesn't guarantee success with others, as circumstances may differ.

### Managing Multiple Claims

**Organize Documentation:** Keep paperwork for each agreement separate and clearly labeled.

**Prioritize by Potential Value:** Consider starting with agreements involving larger loans or longer terms.

**Consider Professional Help:** Multiple claims can be complex; professional assistance may be beneficial.

**Track Each Claim Separately:** Different agreements may progress at different speeds through the claims process.
