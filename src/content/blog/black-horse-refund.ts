One of the UK's largest vehicle finance companies, part of Lloyds Banking Group. Black Horse has provided car finance to millions of UK consumers through hire purchase (HP), Personal Contract Purchase (PCP), and lease purchase agreements.

## Understanding Black Horse Finance

Black Horse Finance is a major player in the UK vehicle finance market. As part of Lloyds Banking Group, they have financed millions of vehicles across the country over many years.

:::keytakeaway Why This Matters Now
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has been investigating motor finance practices, including those of Black Horse, and found widespread issues with commission arrangements between 2007-2024. This has led to a compensation scheme launching in May 2026.
:::

Black Horse offers various car finance options including:
- **Hire Purchase (HP)** - Traditional installment loans where you own the car after final payment
- **Personal Contract Purchase (PCP)** - Lower monthly payments with a balloon payment option
- **Lease Purchase** - Similar to PCP but structured differently

Like many lenders, Black Horse used commission arrangements with car dealers that may not have been adequately disclosed to customers, particularly [Discretionary Commission Arrangements (DCAs)](/car-finance-claims/understanding-discretionary-commission-arrangements) that were banned by the FCA in January 2021.

## What is a Black Horse Finance Claim?

A Black Horse Finance claim is a formal complaint regarding potential mis-selling of your car finance agreement. These claims typically relate to:

:::highlight[blue] Common Claim Types
**Commission Disclosure Issues:** You were not properly informed about commission arrangements between Black Horse and the dealer.

**Discretionary Commission Arrangements (DCAs):** The dealer could increase your interest rate to earn higher commission without your knowledge. Learn more about [what DCAs are](/car-finance-claims/understanding-discretionary-commission-arrangements).

**Irresponsible Lending:** Black Horse provided finance without conducting adequate affordability checks for your circumstances.
:::

If you experienced any of these issues, you may be eligible for compensation.

## How the Car Finance Investigation Started

:::timeline FCA Investigation Timeline
2019: [FCA](https://www.fca.org.uk/) launched market study into motor finance practices
January 2021: DCAs banned by the FCA
January 2024: Comprehensive review announced with complaint handling pause
October 2025: Consultation on Motor Finance Consumer Redress Scheme (CP25/27)
December 2025: Consultation closed
May 2026: Redress scheme launches with published methodologies
:::

The FCA's investigation revealed that many car finance practices were not in consumers' best interests. Discretionary Commission Arrangements were a particular concern, as they allowed dealers to increase interest rates to earn higher commission, creating a clear conflict of interest.

:::stat

label: UK consumers potentially affected by motor finance commission issues
:::

## Discretionary Commission Arrangements Explained

DCAs were commission structures that operated in the car finance industry between 2007 and January 2021.

:::definition DCA (Discretionary Commission Arrangement)
A commission structure that allowed car dealers and brokers to adjust your interest rate. The higher they set your rate, the more commission they earned from the lender - creating a fundamental conflict of interest.
:::

### How DCAs Worked

:::steps The DCA Process
1. **Base Rate Set** - Black Horse would set a base interest rate (e.g., 3% APR)
2. **Dealer Adjustment** - The dealer could increase this rate (e.g., to 7% APR)
3. **Higher Commission** - The extra 4% generated additional commission for the dealer
4. **Customer Unaware** - Most customers were never told about this arrangement
:::

:::warning The Core Problem
Dealers were financially incentivized to charge you higher interest rates, not to secure the best deal for you. This conflict of interest meant you likely paid more than necessary without knowing alternatives existed.
:::

The FCA banned DCAs on 28 January 2021, but consumers with agreements from 2007-2021 may be eligible for compensation through the upcoming redress scheme.

## How Car Finance Deals Have Been Mis-Sold

Several practices in the car finance industry have led to compensation claims:

:::checklist Signs of Mis-Selling
- **Undisclosed Commissions**: You weren't told about commission paid to dealers or brokers
- **Inflated Interest Rates**: Your rate was increased to generate higher dealer commission
- **Lack of Transparency**: Full costs and terms weren't clearly explained
- **Inadequate Affordability Checks**: Finance was approved without proper assessment of your ability to afford it
- **Conflicts of Interest**: The dealer's financial incentive wasn't disclosed
- **Hidden Fees**: Additional charges that weren't properly explained
:::

These practices can result in you paying significantly more than necessary and experiencing financial difficulties as a result. Learn more about [how to check if your car finance was mis-sold](/car-finance-claims/mis-sold-car-finance-claim). Read our complete guide on [mis-sold car finance claims](/car-finance-claims/mis-sold-car-finance-claim) to identify if your agreement was mis-sold.

## Am I Eligible for a Black Horse Finance Claim?

Several factors determine eligibility for Black Horse compensation claims.

:::checklist Eligibility Requirements

- ✅ Commission arrangements were NOT properly disclosed to you
- ✅ You have (or can obtain) records of your finance agreement
- ✅ You were a UK consumer when taking out the finance
- ✅ The agreement was for a vehicle (not other purposes)
:::

### Specific Circumstances That May Qualify

:::highlight[purple] Strong Claim Indicators

**For DCA Claims (2007-2021):**
- Your paperwork contains no mention of commission
- You weren't told dealers could adjust interest rates
- No disclosure of how commission affected your rate
- Agreement was between 6 April 2007 and 28 January 2021
- Read our [PCP claims guide](/car-finance-claims/pcp-claims) if you had a Personal Contract Purchase agreement

**For Commission Disclosure Claims (2007-2024):**
- Commission paid but not adequately disclosed
- You weren't given opportunity for informed consent
- The arrangement created an unfair relationship

**For Irresponsible Lending Claims:**
- Black Horse didn't properly check your income
- Your expenditure wasn't adequately assessed
- The finance was clearly unaffordable for your circumstances
- You experienced financial difficulties as a result
:::

:::infobox[blue] Don't Have Your Documents?
You can request copies from Black Horse under data protection law. Alternatively, claims management companies can retrieve these documents using soft credit checks at no upfront cost.

## How Black Horse Compensation Works

Understanding how compensation is calculated helps set realistic expectations, though final methodologies await the FCA's May 2026 redress scheme.

### Calculation Principles

:::highlight[green] Compensation Approaches

**For DCA Claims:**
The general approach calculates the difference between:
- What you actually paid at the inflated rate
- What you would have paid at the base rate (without discretionary markup)
- Plus 8% statutory interest per year from payment dates

**For Commission Disclosure Claims:**
Two potential methods:
1. **Commission Repayment**: Return of undisclosed commission plus statutory interest
2. **APR Adjustment**: Recalculation at fair rate, refunding the difference plus interest
:::

### Illustrative Example

:::example Understanding Potential Compensation

**Scenario**: Mrs. Y's Black Horse Agreement
- Total charge for credit: £2,096.47
- Broker commission: £1,146.67
- Base rate available: 2.49%
- Rate actually charged: 5.5%

**Outcome**: Black Horse ordered to refund the difference between:
- Interest at 2.49% (what should have been paid)
- Interest at 5.5% (what was actually paid)
- Plus 8% statutory interest for each year since payments

*This is a simplified example. Actual compensation depends on individual circumstances and FCA methodologies.*
:::

:::warning Final Amounts Not Yet Known
The exact compensation methodologies will be published when the FCA redress scheme launches in May 2026. Until then, precise amounts cannot be determined, but understanding these principles helps assess potential claims. For more on compensation calculations, see our [car finance compensation calculator guide](/car-finance-claims/car-finance-compensation-calculation).
:::

### Understanding Your Consumer Rights

:::keytakeaway Your Legal Protections
As a UK consumer, you have important rights regarding loans and finance agreements:

**Fair Treatment**: Lenders must treat you fairly under FCA regulations

**Transparency**: You're entitled to clear information about costs and terms

**Dispute Resolution**: You can challenge incorrect charges or unfair practices

**Compensation**: If you suffered financial loss due to mis-selling, you can seek redress

**Free Alternatives**: You can always claim yourself or use the Financial Ombudsman Service at no cost
:::

## The FCA's Pause on DCA Claims

The FCA has introduced temporary complaint handling rules affecting DCA claims.

:::infobox[amber] Temporary Pause Explained
The FCA noticed inconsistencies in how different lenders were handling DCA claims. To ensure fair, consistent treatment for all consumers, they introduced a pause on DCA claim responses until the redress scheme launches in May 2026.
:::

**What This Means for You:**

:::steps Impact of the Pause
1. **DCA Claims Can Still Be Submitted** - Your claim will be queued for processing
2. **Processed After May 2026** - Once the scheme launches with clear methodologies
3. **Ensures Fair Treatment** - All consumers receive consistent outcomes
4. **Other Claims Proceed Normally** - Irresponsible lending and commission disclosure claims continue
:::

:::highlight[green] Why Submit Now Despite the Pause
- **Secures Your Place**: Claims processed in order received
- **Beats the Rush**: Avoids surge expected at scheme launch
- **Protects Your Position**: Guards against potential future deadlines
- **Time to Gather Evidence**: Allows preparation before processing begins
:::

**Step 2: Assess Eligibility**

**Step 3: Choose Your Approach**

**Step 4: Submit Your Claim**
File your complaint with Black Horse or through your chosen route, providing supporting documentation.

**Step 5: Response & Resolution**
