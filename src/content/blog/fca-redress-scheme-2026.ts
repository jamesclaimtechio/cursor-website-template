The [Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)](https://www.fca.org.uk/) has proposed a comprehensive redress scheme for motor finance consumers, launching in May 2026. Here's everything you need to know. For a complete overview of car finance claims, see our [car finance compensation guide](/car-finance-claims/car-finance-compensation-guide).

The Motor Finance Consumer Redress Scheme is an industry-wide program designed to compensate consumers who were charged undisclosed or excessive commission on car finance between 2007-2024.

:::keytakeaway Historic Consumer Redress
This represents one of the largest consumer redress initiatives in UK financial services history, affecting up to 14 million consumers and costing the industry an estimated £11 billion.
:::

## When Does It Launch?

**May 2026** is the target launch date.

:::timeline Key Dates
October 2025: FCA consultation opened (CP25/27)
December 2025: Consultation closed
Early 2026: Final rules published
May 2026: Scheme launches
:::

:::warning Don't Wait Until May 2026
With up to 14 million potentially eligible consumers, submitting your claim early helps ensure you're at the front of the queue when the scheme launches. Claims submitted now will be processed first.
:::

## Who Is Eligible?

:::checklist You May Be Eligible If:
- Had motor finance agreements between 2007-2024
- Were subject to [Discretionary Commission Arrangements (DCAs)](/car-finance-claims/understanding-discretionary-commission-arrangements)
- Were not adequately informed about commission
- Had agreements with participating lenders (like [Black Horse](/car-finance-claims/black-horse-refund))
:::

According to FCA estimates, **up to 14 million consumers** may be eligible.

## How Will It Work?

:::steps The Scheme Process
1. **Presumption of Harm** - If disclosure was inadequate, you're presumed to have suffered loss (lenders must prove otherwise)
2. **Lender Review** - Lenders review your agreement, assess disclosure, and calculate redress if applicable
3. **Rebuttal Available** - Lenders can challenge the presumption with evidence (e.g., 0% APR deals, clear disclosure)
4. **Escalation Rights** - If unsatisfied, escalate to the [Financial Ombudsman Service](https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/) or FCA procedures
:::

### How the Burden of Proof Works

:::highlight[green] This Shifts the Advantage to Consumers
The scheme creates a presumption that if disclosure was inadequate, you suffered loss. This is significant: **lenders must prove you weren't harmed**, rather than you proving you were. This makes claims much easier for consumers.
:::

## What Compensation Can You Get?

The scheme proposes **two remedies**:

:::example Remedy 1: Commission Repayment
Return of the undisclosed commission paid, plus statutory interest (8% per year). This is the simpler calculation.

**Example**: If £1,500 commission was paid in 2015:
- Commission: £1,500
- Statutory interest (8% for ~10 years): ~£1,200
- **Total: ~£2,700**
:::

:::example Remedy 2: APR Adjustment
Calculation of what you would have paid without the inflated commission, with the difference refunded.

**Example**: If your APR was 8% instead of 6%:
- Extra interest paid over 4 years: ~£1,800
- Statutory interest: ~£400
- **Total: ~£2,200**
:::

:::infobox[blue] Consistent Methodologies
The FCA will set out clear methodologies for calculating redress to ensure consistency across lenders. You'll receive whichever remedy gives you the higher amount.
:::

## Industry Impact

The redress scheme is expected to cost the motor finance industry approximately **£11 billion** (including implementation costs).

Major affected lenders include:
- [Black Horse Finance](/car-finance-claims/black-horse-refund)
- [Close Brothers Motor Finance](/car-finance-claims/close-brothers-motor-finance-claims)
- MotoNovo
- Santander Consumer Finance
- Barclays Partner Finance
- And many more...

## Why Get Your Claim In Early?

With up to 14 million potentially eligible consumers, the scheme will face significant volume:

:::highlight[purple] Beat the Rush
Claims submitted before May 2026 will be queued and processed first when the scheme launches. With millions of claims expected, being at the front of the queue could mean receiving your compensation months or even years earlier.
:::

:::steps Advantages of Early Claims
1. **Queue Position** - First in, first reviewed when scheme launches
2. **Faster Resolution** - Lenders process in order received
3. **Avoid Rush** - Beat the May 2026 surge of last-minute claims
4. **Documentation** - Time to gather information and ensure claim is complete
:::

## Current Status (December 2025)

The FCA has:
- Closed consultation on CP25/27
- Extended complaint handling pause to December 4, 2025
- Published policy statements on handling procedures
- Set framework for May 2026 launch

Lenders are currently:
- Pausing complaints under FCA rules
- Preparing systems for the scheme
- Training staff on new procedures
- Reviewing historical agreements

    {
      question: "Why does the FCA redress scheme launch in May 2026?",
      answer: "The FCA has set this timeline to allow lenders to prepare their systems, establish fair compensation methodologies, and ensure the scheme can handle the volume of claims expected. This follows the Supreme Court ruling in August 2025 and subsequent FCA consultation."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I submit my claim before May 2026?",
      answer: "Claims submitted before May 2026 will be queued and processed when the scheme launches. Getting your claim in early helps ensure you're at the front of the queue, which may result in faster processing once the scheme opens."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I definitely receive compensation?",
      answer: "Compensation depends on your individual circumstances and whether your agreement included problematic commission arrangements. The FCA scheme establishes a presumption of harm where disclosure was inadequate, but lenders can rebut this with evidence. Each claim is assessed on its merits."
