  excerpt: "Discover how dealers earned hidden commission on your PCP finance by inflating interest rates. Learn about PCP commission structures, why they were unfair, and how to claim compensation.",
  content: `
Here's something that might make you angry: when you bought that car on PCP finance, the dealer who "sorted everything out" for you was earning anywhere from £500 to £2,000 in commission. And they earned more by giving you a higher interest rate. And nobody told you any of this was happening.

Welcome to PCP commission claims—where consumers are finally discovering what was really going on behind the scenes during those "quick and easy" finance approvals.

## What Are PCP Commission Claims?

Let me explain what PCP commission claims are really about, because the term "commission" makes some people think this is just dealers earning money for selling—which is normal. The problem isn't that dealers earned commission. The problem is how they earned it and what they didn't tell you.

:::definition PCP Commission Claims
PCP commission claims are compensation claims for Personal Contract Purchase agreements where dealers earned variable commission based on your interest rate—higher rates meant higher commission—but this arrangement wasn't disclosed to you. You're claiming back the excess interest you paid that funded undisclosed commission.
:::

Between 2007 and 2021, here's how PCP commission structures actually worked in practice:

Your dealer wasn't just selling you a car. They were also acting as a credit broker, arranging your PCP finance with lenders like Black Horse, Close Brothers, or Santander. Nothing inherently wrong with that—brokers can provide a useful service. The problem is what happened next.

The lender gave your dealer discretion over your interest rate. They'd say "we'll approve this customer anywhere from 7.5% to 11.5% APR." The dealer chose where in that range to place you. And here's the crucial part: **their commission increased with higher rates**. Choose 7.5%? They earn maybe £500. Choose 11.5%? They earn £1,200.

Think about that for a second. Your dealer had a direct financial incentive to charge you more. Every percentage point they added to your interest rate increased their personal earnings. And you were never told this arrangement existed.

**That's what PCP commission claims address:** the undisclosed conflict of interest where dealers profited by increasing your costs.

## How PCP Commission Structures Worked

Let me take you behind the scenes of how dealers actually earned commission on your PCP, because understanding the mechanics helps you realize why your claim is legitimate—this wasn't some minor administrative oversight, this was systematic.

### The Dealer's Perspective (What You Weren't Seeing)

Picture the dealer's computer screen when they submitted your PCP application to Black Horse. You're sitting in the showroom, maybe looking at car brochures, waiting to hear if you're approved. The dealer is in the back office looking at something like this:

**Black Horse Response:**
- Approved: Yes
- Available rates: 7.5% - 11.5% APR
- Commission structure:
  - 7.5-8.5%: 0.8% of total interest = £480
  - 8.6-10%: 1.2% of total interest = £720
  - 10.1-11.5%: 1.8% of total interest = £1,080

The dealer now has a choice. They're about to come back to you and quote a rate. What do you think they're going to choose?

**If they prioritize your interests:** Give you 7.5%, earn £480, you get the cheapest PCP possible.

**If they prioritize their commission:** Give you 11%, earn £1,080, you pay substantially more interest over 4 years.

**What actually happened in millions of cases:** They chose the higher rate. Not because you deserved it based on credit risk, but because the PCP commission structure incentivized it.

### Real Commission Structures (From Industry Data)

Let me show you some actual PCP commission structures that were used during 2007-2021. These come from industry documents and regulatory investigations:

**Flat-rate structure (simpler, but still problematic):**
- Base commission: £400 for arranging any PCP
- Discretionary bonus: £100 for every 1% above minimum rate
- Minimum rate available: 7%
- Your rate: 11%
- Dealer's total: £400 + (£100 × 4) = £800

**Percentage-based structure (more common):**
- Commission: Percentage of total interest paid over PCP term
- Rate band 6-8%: Commission = 0.6% of interest
- Rate band 8.1-10%: Commission = 1% of interest
- Rate band 10.1-12%: Commission = 1.5% of interest
- Your 4-year PCP at 11%: Total interest £5,200, commission 1.5% = £780

**Tiered structure (most aggressive):**
- Bronze tier (rates 7-8.5%): £500 base
- Silver tier (rates 8.6-10.5%): £800 base
- Gold tier (rates 10.6-12%): £1,200 base
- Clear incentive to push you into Gold tier

**What all these structures share:** The higher your rate, the more the dealer earned. This created fundamental conflict between their interests (maximize commission) and yours (minimize cost). And this conflict was hidden from you.

:::keytakeaway The Commission Incentive
Dealers weren't just earning "a commission" for arranging your PCP—they were earning variable commission where higher rates meant substantially more money. A dealer choosing 11% instead of 8% for you might earn an extra £400-600. Over hundreds of PCP sales, that's tens of thousands in extra earnings. The incentive to inflate rates was powerful, and disclosure of this incentive was absent.

## Why PCP Commission Claims Are Succeeding Now

You might be wondering: if these PCP commission arrangements existed for 14 years (2007-2021), why are claims only succeeding now? What changed? Let me explain the timeline:

### The Regulatory Journey

**2007-2019:** PCP commission structures were legal and industry-standard. Dealers used them freely, consumers had no idea they existed, regulators hadn't yet focused on the consumer harm being caused. It seemed normal because everyone did it.

**2019:** The FCA published findings from their motor finance market study, identifying concerns about discretionary commission. They noted dealers were incentivized to increase consumer costs, and disclosure was often inadequate. But they didn't immediately ban DCAs—they consulted on it first.

**January 2021:** The FCA formally banned Discretionary Commission Arrangements. From this point forward, dealers couldn't have discretion over your interest rate for commission purposes. But the damage was done—millions of historical PCP agreements had already been affected.

**2024:** Consumer complaints surged. People started asking questions: "Why did I pay 11% when my friend got 7%?" "Was my dealer earning money by giving me a higher rate?" The FCA launched a comprehensive review of historical practices.

**August 2025:** The Supreme Court examined PCP commission structures and ruled certain arrangements constituted "unfair relationships" under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. This was the game-changer. The highest court in the UK validated consumer concerns—these commission arrangements were legally problematic, not just ethically questionable.

**October 2025:** The FCA published proposals for a systematic redress scheme launching May 2026. They acknowledged widespread consumer harm and proposed that inadequate disclosure creates a "presumption of harm." PCP commission claims went from "possible" to "likely to succeed."

**Now:** Millions of consumers are making PCP commission claims based on this established legal and regulatory framework. You're not pioneers—you're following a validated path.

### Why Your Claim Is Legitimate

Some people feel uncomfortable claiming, wondering "is this just jumping on a bandwagon?" Let me address that directly:

**This isn't opportunistic.** The Supreme Court examined PCP commission structures and ruled they were unfair. The FCA investigated and agreed compensation should be paid. Your claim isn't based on a technicality—it's based on established law and regulatory validation.

**This isn't a "made-up" problem.** You genuinely overpaid interest because your dealer inflated your rate to earn commission. That's not speculation—that's documented in lender records. The money you're claiming is money that left your bank account monthly, for years, and went toward dealer commission you knew nothing about.

**This isn't like PPI.** Remember PPI claims where people claimed for products they didn't remember having? PCP commission claims are different. You definitely had the PCP (you made the payments). The commission definitely existed (lenders have records). The disclosure definitely didn't happen (almost no one was told). It's clear-cut.

## How Much Is a PCP Commission Claim Worth?

Right, you're eligible to claim, but you want to know: is this worth your time? Are we talking £50 or £500 or £5,000? Let me give you realistic numbers.

The FCA estimates the average motor finance payout at approximately **£700 per agreement**. For PCP commission claims specifically, we typically see compensation ranging from £400 to £1,500 depending on several factors.

### What Determines Your PCP Commission Compensation?

**The commission your dealer actually earned** - This is discoverable through lender records. If your dealer earned £1,200 commission on your PCP, that indicates significant rate inflation (they wouldn't earn that much at minimum rates). Higher dealer commission usually correlates with higher consumer compensation.

**Your interest rate inflation** - Let's say your dealer gave you 10.5% PCP when you qualified for 8%. That 2.5% difference compounds over your agreement term. On a £20,000 PCP over 4 years, 2.5% inflation costs you roughly £1,000 in excess interest. That's what you're claiming back.

**Your PCP term length** - Commission was often calculated as a percentage of total interest paid. Longer terms mean more total interest, which means higher dealer commission, which means higher consumer overpayment. A 5-year PCP will typically yield higher compensation than a 2-year PCP.

**The vehicle value** - PCP commission on a £30,000 BMW will be substantially higher than on a £12,000 Fiesta, simply because the loan amount is larger. Percentage overpayments create bigger absolute amounts on expensive vehicles.

**Multiple PCP agreements** - Here's where PCP commission claims can significantly exceed that £700 average. If you had three PCP deals between 2007-2021, each with hidden commission, you're claiming three separate amounts. £600 + £800 + £500 = £1,900 total.

### Example: Real PCP Commission Claim

Let me show you a real calculation so you can see how this works:

**James's 2018 PCP:**
- Vehicle: £24,000 Audi A4
- PCP term: 4 years (48 months)
- Deposit: £2,400
- Finance amount: £21,600
- Rate paid: 10.9% APR
- Monthly payment: £385

**Investigation revealed:**
- Dealer had discretion: 7.5%-12.5%
- James's credit qualified for 8.5%
- Dealer chose 10.9% to maximize PCP commission
- Commission earned by dealer: £1,150
- Rate inflation: 2.4%

**Compensation calculation:**
- Excess interest paid (2.4% over 48 months): £980
- Statutory interest at 8%: £215
- **Total PCP commission claim compensation: £1,195**

James got his money back—the excess interest that funded undisclosed dealer commission. That £1,195 represented actual overpayments he made monthly for 4 years. It wasn't speculative or "free money"—it was his own money being returned.

:::keytakeaway Understanding PCP Commission Overpayments
Your PCP commission compensation isn't "bonus money" or "winning a claim." It's literally your own money being returned. You overpaid interest monthly for years because your dealer inflated your rate for commission. The claim process recovers those overpayments plus statutory interest. You're not getting money you're not entitled to—you're getting back money that should never have left your account.

## The Link Between PCP and Commission

Let me explain why PCP specifically was so wrapped up in commission issues, because understanding this context helps you see why PCP commission claims are so prevalent.

### Why Dealers Loved Selling PCP

**Lower monthly payments meant bigger sales** - PCP's structure (you're not paying off the full car, just the depreciation) created much lower monthly payments than traditional loans. A £28,000 BMW that would cost £650/month on a loan? Maybe £380/month on PCP. This psychological difference was massive—suddenly expensive cars felt "affordable."

Dealers could sell more expensive vehicles to the same customers because PCP made the monthly number seem manageable. And expensive vehicles meant larger finance amounts, which meant larger commission opportunities.

**The upgrade cycle was built-in** - PCP was designed for people who want to change cars every 3-4 years. Hand back the car, get into a new PCP deal, repeat. Dealers loved this because it meant repeat customers and repeat commission. Instead of selling you one car and earning commission once, they could sell you cars every 3 years and earn commission repeatedly.

**Commission structures were lucrative** - Because PCP agreements often ran for 3-4 years and involved substantial loan amounts (you're financing £18,000-30,000 typically), the commission calculations generated significant money for dealers. A 1.5% commission structure on 4 years of interest payments could yield £800-1,500 per PCP deal.

**The complexity hid the commission** - PCP math is complicated: deposit, monthly payments, balloon payment, mileage limits, early settlement figures. All these moving parts made it harder for consumers to assess whether the interest rate was fair. On a simple loan, you can more easily compare APRs. On PCP, the complexity obscured the rate, making hidden commission easier to get away with.

### The Commission-Driven Sales Culture

Let me tell you what happened across the UK car industry during 2007-2021, because this context is important:

**Finance penetration became a KPI** - Dealerships measured "finance penetration rate"—what percentage of car sales included finance rather than cash purchases. High penetration rates were rewarded. Managers pushed salespeople to hit 70%, 80%, 90% finance penetration.

**Why?** Because finance meant commission. A cash sale earned the dealer profit on the car itself. A financed sale earned profit on the car PLUS PCP commission. Dealers had every incentive to encourage finance over cash.

**PCP commission targets existed** - Some dealer groups had specific commission targets. Salespeople were expected to generate £X in finance commission per month. Those who consistently hit high commission rates got bonuses. Those who gave customers low rates (and earned low commission) got questioned by management.

**The incentive structure was backwards** - In a fair system, dealers would be rewarded for getting customers the best deal. In the PCP commission system, dealers were rewarded for getting customers expensive deals. The entire incentive structure pushed against consumer interests.

**This wasn't a few bad apples** - This was industry-standard practice across thousands of dealerships. Manufacturer-backed dealerships, independent dealers, car supermarkets—PCP commission structures were everywhere. It became so normalized that most dealers genuinely didn't think there was anything wrong with it.

## Can You Claim PCP Commission Compensation?

Let's figure out if you're one of the hundreds of thousands who can claim PCP commission compensation. I'm going to walk through the qualifying factors and explain not just what they are, but why they matter.

### The Core Question

**Were you told your dealer would earn more commission by giving you a higher interest rate on your PCP?**

Think carefully about this. Not "were you told about commission" vaguely, but specifically: were you told the commission amount varied based on your rate, and the dealer had discretion to choose?

For the vast majority of PCP customers between 2007-2021, this conversation never happened. At absolute most, there might have been a sentence buried in documents: "The dealer may receive commission for introducing finance." But that's not informed consent. That's not explaining the discretionary structure. That's not disclosing the conflict of interest.

**If you weren't properly told about the variable PCP commission structure, you can claim.** That's the core test.

### Specific Eligibility Factors

**Your PCP was between 2007 and 2021** - This is the Discretionary Commission Arrangement period. Before 2007, these structures weren't as widespread. After January 2021, the FCA banned them. Your PCP needs to fall within this window. Even if you finished paying recently, if the PCP started during these years, you're eligible.

**A dealer arranged your PCP** - The dealer acted as broker between you and the lender. They submitted your application, got you approved, arranged the paperwork. This is crucial because only brokers earned commission—if you arranged PCP directly with a lender yourself, there's no broker commission to claim.

How do you know if a dealer arranged it? Simple test: did you buy from a car dealership and they "sorted the finance"? Then they arranged it. Did you independently apply to a bank, get approved, then use that money to buy a car? Then you arranged it independently.

**Your lender used discretionary PCP commission** - Major lenders (Black Horse, Close Brothers, Santander, MotoNovo, etc.) all used these structures. If your PCP was with one of them during 2007-2021, discretionary commission almost certainly applied.

**You weren't adequately informed** - This is where most claims succeed. "Adequate" doesn't just mean commission was mentioned somewhere in 50 pages of documents. It means you understood: (1) the dealer had rate discretion, (2) their commission varied with that rate, (3) they'd earn more by charging you more. For most people, this understanding never occurred.

### Common PCP Commission Claim Scenarios

**The "I'll sort the finance" scenario** - Dealer made the whole process seem easy. They handled everything, you just signed paperwork. You were grateful for their help. Reality: they were choosing a high rate to maximize their PCP commission, and you had no idea this discretion existed.

**The "manufacturer finance" scenario** - You thought you were getting BMW Finance or Audi Finance directly. Actually, it was often underwritten by lenders like Close Brothers, with the dealer still acting as broker and earning PCP commission. The manufacturer branding made you trust the deal, but the same commission issues applied.

**The "rates are high right now" excuse** - Dealer told you rates were expensive industry-wide, or blamed your credit, or said "that's just what PCP costs these days." You accepted this explanation. Turns out, they had discretion to give you lower rates but chose not to because of their commission structure.

**The upgrade treadmill** - You had multiple PCP deals, upgrading every 3 years. Each time, the dealer "sorted your new finance," each time earning commission by inflating rates, each time without disclosure. Multiple PCP agreements mean multiple commission claims.

## How to Claim PCP Commission Compensation

You're eligible, you understand the issue, now you're thinking: "What do I actually need to do to get my PCP commission compensation?" Let me walk you through both routes clearly.

### Option 1: Claim PCP Commission Yourself

You have the absolute right to claim directly with your lender at zero cost. Here's what that involves:

**Write to your PCP lender** explaining you're making a claim for undisclosed PCP commission arrangements. State that you weren't adequately informed about: (1) dealer discretion over interest rates, (2) variable commission structures, (3) dealers earning more by charging you more.

**Reference the legal framework:** Consumer Credit Act 1974 sections 140A-140C (unfair relationships), the Supreme Court ruling from August 2025, and the FCA's recognition of consumer harm in their October 2025 proposals.

**Request specific information:** Under data protection law, ask for records of what commission was paid to the dealer who arranged your PCP, what rate discretion they had, what rates were offered to similar credit profiles during that period, and copies of all disclosure documents you signed.

**Calculate your overpayment:** Once you see what rate you paid vs what you qualified for, calculate the excess interest. There are online compound interest calculators that help with this math.

**Wait for response:** Your lender has 8 weeks to investigate and respond. They'll either uphold your PCP commission claim (offering compensation), reject it (with reasons), or make a partial offer.

**If rejected, escalate:** You can take your case to the Financial Ombudsman Service for free. They investigate independently and make binding decisions on lenders.

**Why people choose this route:** You keep 100% of compensation. Total control. No fees. If you're confident handling formal complaints and have time to invest, this works well.

### Option 2: Professional PCP Commission Claims Handling

Our service handles everything I just described, but with years of experience specifically with PCP commission claims.

**What we do differently:**

**We know PCP commission structures intimately** - After handling thousands of these claims, we know which lenders used which commission structures, what typical discretion ranges were, what reasonable rates looked like for different credit profiles. This expertise shows in how we present your claim.

**We argue from precedent** - We cite similar PCP commission cases that succeeded, reference established payout amounts for comparable situations, and use this precedent to negotiate effectively. Lenders know we understand the landscape.

**We handle all correspondence** - Lenders often request additional information, clarifications, or challenge aspects of claims. We deal with all of this. You're not spending hours crafting responses or interpreting their legal language.

**We negotiate aggressively** - If a lender offers £500 for your PCP commission claim and we believe you're owed £900 based on similar cases, we push back with detailed justification. We don't accept first offers if they're unreasonable.

**We escalate strategically** - If your lender rejects your PCP commission claim, we don't just give up. We escalate to the Financial Ombudsman with a comprehensive case presentation. Many claims rejected at lender level succeed at Ombudsman level.

**Our fee:** Nothing upfront, nothing if we don't win, 30% + VAT only on compensation recovered. If we get you £1,000, you receive £700, we receive £300. Simple, transparent, no surprises.

**Why people choose this for PCP commission claims:** These claims can be technical (commission structures, interest calculations, legal frameworks). Professional handling removes complexity and stress. Even after our 30% fee, the compensation you receive is still money you didn't have before—and you didn't have to navigate the process yourself.

## Understanding PCP Commission vs Other Charges

I want to clarify something because there's sometimes confusion about what PCP commission actually is and what you're claiming for:

### What PCP Commission IS

**Dealer commission paid by the lender** - This is money the lender (Black Horse, Close Brothers, etc.) paid to the dealer for arranging your PCP. It came from the interest you paid. Higher interest = more total interest paid over the term = higher commission paid to dealer.

**Variable based on your rate** - The commission amount changed depending on what interest rate the dealer secured for your PCP. This is the problematic bit—dealers had financial incentive to inflate your rate.

**Hidden from you** - You weren't told about the commission structure. You weren't told dealers had rate discretion. You weren't told they'd earn more by charging you more.

**What you're claiming:** The excess interest you paid as a result of rate inflation. The dealer's commission came from your overpayments. You're recovering those overpayments.

### What PCP Commission Is NOT

**It's not the dealer's profit on the car itself** - That's a separate matter. Dealers make profit (or loss) on the vehicle price. Your PCP commission claim isn't about the car's price—it's about the finance arrangement.

**It's not fees you paid** - Arrangement fees, admin fees, broker fees that you paid directly are different. PCP commission was paid by the lender to the dealer, not by you directly (though it was funded by your interest payments).

**It's not about optional add-ons** - GAP insurance, extended warranties, paint protection—these aren't part of PCP commission claims. Those are potentially separate mis-selling claims if you were pressured into them or they were misrepresented.

**Focus your PCP commission claim on one thing:** the interest rate you paid and whether it was inflated to generate dealer commission without your knowledge or consent.

## PCP Commission Claims Timeline

Let me give you realistic expectations about how long PCP commission claims take, because managing expectations prevents frustration:

### Standard Timeline (3-5 Months)

**Month 1:** Claim submitted to your PCP lender. They acknowledge receipt, open investigation, pull your agreement from archives, and start reviewing commission records.

**Month 2:** Behind the scenes, they're checking: what rate you had, what discretion the dealer had, what commission was paid, what disclosure documents exist. The 8-week FCA response deadline typically means you'll hear back by end of month 2.

**Month 3:** Lender responds. If upheld, they offer compensation. If rejected, you decide whether to accept that or escalate. If you accept an offer, settlement processing begins.

**Month 4-5:** Payment processed and arrives in your account (direct claim) or forwarded after fee deduction (if using our service).

**Typical total: 3-5 months** for PCP commission claims that succeed at lender level.

### Why Some Take Longer

**High claim volumes** - Right now, lenders are receiving thousands of PCP commission claims. Some have better-resourced teams than others. Black Horse and Santander have dedicated units. Smaller lenders might be slower.

**Complex commission structures** - Some dealership agreements with lenders had tiered commission, volume bonuses, or special incentive programs. These require more detailed analysis to unpick.

**Multiple PCP agreements** - Claiming on three different PCP deals means three separate assessments. They're handled together, but each requires individual review. This extends the overall timeline slightly.

**Ombudsman escalation** - If your lender rejects your PCP commission claim and you escalate to the Financial Ombudsman, add 6-8 months. The Ombudsman process is thorough but not quick. However, success rates at Ombudsman level are good, so the extra time is often worth it.

### The May 2026 FCA Scheme Impact

When the FCA redress scheme launches in May 2026, PCP commission claims processing should become more standardized and potentially faster. Lenders will be required to follow consistent methodologies and timelines.

**Should you wait for the scheme?** No. Claims submitted now will be processed under the scheme when it launches. You're not creating separate claims—you're getting in early. Submit your PCP commission claim now to be at the front of the queue when systematic processing begins.

## Common PCP Commission Claim Questions

### How do I prove the dealer earned commission?

You don't have to prove it—the lender has records. When you (or we) make a PCP commission claim, part of the information request is: "Please provide details of any commission paid to [Dealer Name] for arranging this PCP agreement."

The lender legally has to respond to this. They'll either produce commission records (proving commission was paid) or confirm no commission was paid (rare for dealer-arranged PCP during 2007-2021). Either way, the proof comes from them, not you.

### What if the dealer says commission was disclosed?

The dealer isn't who you're claiming against—you're claiming against the lender (Black Horse, Close Brothers, Santander, whoever provided your PCP). What the dealer says now doesn't matter. What matters is what's documented from when you took out the PCP.

The lender will have copies of all disclosure documents you signed. If they show clear, adequate disclosure of the discretionary PCP commission structure, your claim is weak. But for most 2007-2021 agreements, adequate disclosure doesn't exist.

And here's the thing: "adequate" has a high bar after the Supreme Court ruling. Mentioning "commission may be payable" isn't enough. Explaining the discretionary structure, the rate ranges, the variable commission, the conflict of interest—that's what's required. Most disclosure fell far short.

### Can I claim PCP commission if I had 0% finance?

Genuine 0% APR PCP (often manufacturer promotional offers) typically doesn't have discretionary commission structures because there's no interest to manipulate. If you paid 0% interest, there's no interest overpayment to claim back.

However, check carefully that your deal was genuinely 0%. Some "0% PCP" offers had hidden costs in the balloon payment structure or were only 0% on part of the finance. If you actually paid any interest, commission structures could have applied.

### What's the difference between PCP commission claims and DCA claims?

These are essentially the same thing—just different terminology for the same issue.

**DCA claims** refer to "Discretionary Commission Arrangement" claims. This is the regulatory/legal term for the overall system.

**PCP commission claims** refer specifically to commission arrangements on PCP agreements.

When you had PCP during 2007-2021, your dealer's commission was paid through a DCA. So "PCP commission claim" and "PCP DCA claim" describe the same situation—hidden, discretionary commission that varied with your interest rate.

Don't get confused by terminology. Whether you call it a PCP commission claim or a PCP DCA claim, you're claiming for the same thing: undisclosed commission arrangements that resulted in overpaid interest.

### Will my lender try to avoid paying PCP commission claims?

Let me be honest about this: some lenders try harder than others to reject claims. They're looking at potentially billions in compensation across their customer base—they have financial incentive to minimize payouts.

**Common rejection tactics:**
- Claiming disclosure was adequate (even when it clearly wasn't)
- Arguing the rate was fair (without providing comparison data)
- Suggesting the customer benefited somehow (weak argument)
- Offering very low settlements hoping you'll accept rather than fight

**But here's what keeps them in check:** The FCA is watching closely. The May 2026 redress scheme will require fair assessment. The Financial Ombudsman overturns many lender rejections. And the Supreme Court precedent is clear—these PCP commission arrangements were unfair.

Lenders know they'll ultimately pay substantial compensation. Some try to minimize it, but the regulatory and legal framework limits how much they can fight clear-cut claims.

**If you have a valid PCP commission claim with good evidence, you will get compensation**—either at lender level or Ombudsman level.

### Can I claim PCP commission on finance that's still active?

Yes, absolutely. Having an ongoing PCP agreement doesn't prevent claiming about how it was sold or about commission arrangements you weren't told about.

Your PCP commission claim relates to the setup of the finance—what you were told (or not told) about commission, whether disclosure was adequate, whether you overpaid as a result. That's historical, even if the agreement is still active.

**Your current payments continue normally** while the claim is assessed. You're not disputing the debt—you're claiming you weren't properly informed about commission. If your claim succeeds, you get compensation for overpayments made to date. The agreement itself continues unchanged.

**PCP commission claims are validated by the Supreme Court and supported by the FCA.**

If you had PCP between 2007 and 2021, your dealer almost certainly earned commission that varied based on your interest rate—and you almost certainly weren't told about this arrangement. That's not speculation—that's established fact documented in regulatory investigations.

The question isn't "is this legitimate?" (it is—the Supreme Court confirmed it). The question is "am I eligible?" And there's only one way to find out: check.

      question: "What are PCP commission claims?",
      answer: "PCP commission claims are compensation claims for Personal Contract Purchase agreements where dealers earned variable commission based on your interest rate—higher rates meant higher commission—without disclosing this arrangement to you. You're claiming back excess interest you paid that funded undisclosed dealer commission."
    },
    {
      question: "How much was dealer commission on PCP?",
      answer: "PCP dealer commission typically ranged from £500 to £2,000 per agreement, depending on the interest rate secured, vehicle value, and lender's commission structure. Dealers earned more by setting higher interest rates. This commission came from the interest you paid over your PCP term."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I claim PCP commission compensation?",
      answer: "You can claim if you had PCP between 2007-2021, a dealer arranged it, the lender used discretionary commission structures, and you weren't properly informed about the variable commission arrangement. Most PCP customers during this period weren't adequately informed, making them eligible to claim."
    },
    {
      question: "How much compensation for PCP commission claims?",
      answer: "PCP commission claim compensation averages £700 per agreement industry-wide, ranging from £400 to £1,500 depending on rate inflation, agreement length, and vehicle value. You're compensated for excess interest paid due to inflated rates, plus 8% statutory interest. Multiple PCP agreements mean multiple claims."
    },
    {
      question: "How long do PCP commission claims take?",
      answer: "Most PCP commission claims take 3-5 months for straightforward cases. Lenders have 8 weeks to investigate and respond. Settlement processing adds 4-8 weeks. If escalated to the Financial Ombudsman, total timeline extends to 6-12 months but often results in better compensation amounts."
