Here's something you might not know about Close Brothers Motor Finance: they weren't just another lender in the car finance industry—they were one of the named defendants in the 2025 Supreme Court case that changed everything for millions of consumers. If you had finance with them between 2007 and 2021, that court case might just have validated your right to compensation.

Let me explain what happened, why Close Brothers is particularly significant, and whether you're one of the hundreds of thousands of their customers who could claim.

## What is Close Brothers Motor Finance?

Before we dive into claims, let's talk about who Close Brothers actually are—because many people had their finance without really understanding who they were dealing with.

Close Brothers Motor Finance isn't some fly-by-night operation. They're part of Close Brothers Group PLC, a merchant banking group that's been around since 1878 and is listed on the London Stock Exchange. Respectable, established, one of the major players in UK motor finance.

During the 2000s and 2010s, they became one of the go-to lenders for independent car dealerships. Not the manufacturers (they're not BMW Finance or VW Finance), but the independent dealers, the car supermarkets, the used car specialists. If you bought from one of those dealerships and they "arranged the finance" for you, there's a decent chance it was with Close Brothers.

**Here's what made them popular with dealers:** Close Brothers offered competitive commission structures and relatively quick approval processes. Dealers loved working with them. The question is: did anyone tell you about those commission structures when you were signing paperwork? For most customers, the answer is no.

## Why Are People Claiming Against Close Brothers?

The Close Brothers situation goes beyond just the general car finance scandal—there's a specific legal precedent that makes claims against them particularly significant.

### The Supreme Court Case That Changed Everything

In August 2025, the Supreme Court handed down a ruling on motor finance commission arrangements. Close Brothers was specifically named as one of the defendant lenders in this case. Let me tell you why this matters so much for your potential claim.

The court examined Close Brothers' commission practices during the DCA period and ruled that certain arrangements constituted an "unfair relationship" under the [Consumer Credit Act 1974](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/consumer-credit-act). This wasn't just an abstract legal principle—the court looked at how Close Brothers actually operated, how dealers were compensated, and what consumers were told (or not told).

**The key finding:** Dealers needed to obtain "informed consent" before earning commission by influencing your interest rate. For Close Brothers customers, that informed consent was almost never obtained. The commission arrangements existed, dealers were earning money by setting your rate, but you weren't properly informed about this setup.

This Supreme Court precedent gives Close Brothers claims a particularly strong legal foundation. When you submit a claim against Close Brothers, you're not just pointing to general industry practices—you're citing a Supreme Court ruling that specifically examined their practices and found them problematic.

### The Hidden Commission System

Let me walk you through how Close Brothers' system actually worked during 2007-2021, because understanding this helps you realize your claim is legitimate.

When you bought your car and the dealer said "I'll sort the finance," here's what happened behind the scenes:

**Step 1:** The dealer submitted your details to Close Brothers. Your credit profile, income, the car you wanted—all sent through to their underwriting team.

**Step 2:** Close Brothers assessed your application and decided on a rate range. Maybe they determined you qualified for anywhere from 7.5% to 11.5% APR based on your credit and the vehicle.

**Step 3:** They communicated this range back to the dealer. Not to you—to the dealer. You were sitting in the showroom thinking "I wonder if I'll be approved," while the dealer was looking at a screen showing they could offer you anything from 7.5% to 11.5%.

**Step 4:** The dealer chose your rate. And here's the crucial part: Close Brothers paid them higher commission for choosing higher rates. Set you at 7.5%? Modest commission. Set you at 11.5%? Substantially higher commission. The dealer had a financial incentive to charge you more.

**Step 5:** The dealer came back to you and said "great news, you're approved at 9.9%!" As if this was the only rate available. As if they'd fought to get you the best deal. No mention of the discretion they had, no explanation of the commission structure, no disclosure that they'd earn more by charging you more.

**This is what the Supreme Court examined and said was unfair.** Not because commission is inherently wrong, but because the combination of discretion and undisclosed incentives created a fundamentally unfair relationship between you and Close Brothers.

:::keytakeaway Close Brothers' Unique Position
Because Close Brothers was named in the Supreme Court case, claims against them have particularly strong legal precedent. The highest court in the UK examined their specific practices and ruled they created unfair relationships. This isn't speculation—it's established case law.

## Can You Claim Against Close Brothers Motor Finance?

Let's figure out if you're one of the hundreds of thousands of Close Brothers customers who could claim compensation.

The key question isn't just "did I have Close Brothers finance?"—it's "was I properly told about the dealer's commission arrangements?" And for the vast majority of Close Brothers customers during 2007-2021, the answer is no.

### How to Know If You're Eligible

Think back to when you bought your car. I'm going to walk through the typical Close Brothers customer experience, and I want you to see if it matches your memory:

**You went to an independent dealership** - Probably not a main dealer (VW, BMW, etc.) but an independent used car dealer or car supermarket. These dealers often used Close Brothers because of their competitive terms and dealer-friendly processes.

**The dealer "sorted the finance"** - They might have said "leave it with me," or "I'll see what I can do for you," or "let me make some calls." They positioned themselves as helpful, working on your behalf to get you approved. What they didn't mention: they were choosing your interest rate from a range, and they'd earn more commission by choosing the higher end.

**You never saw alternatives** - Did the dealer show you quotes from multiple lenders? Did they explain you could check with your bank? Or did they present the Close Brothers offer as if it was the only option? Most dealers who worked primarily with one lender didn't encourage comparison shopping.

**The agreement was between 2007-2021** - This is the critical timeframe. Close Brothers used Discretionary Commission Arrangements during these years, giving dealers the discretion to adjust your rate. Even if you've finished paying, or handed back the car, or it was years ago—if your Close Brothers finance started in this window, you can claim.

**You weren't explicitly told about commission** - At most, you might have seen a line buried in documents saying "we may receive a commission for arranging finance." But were you told the commission amount varied based on your interest rate? Were you told dealers earned more by charging you more? That's the informed consent that was required but almost never obtained.

If most of these points match your experience, you're very likely eligible for a Close Brothers claim.

### Which Close Brothers Finance Products Are Affected?

The commission issues affected all of Close Brothers' finance products during the DCA period. Let me explain each one:

**PCP (Personal Contract Purchase)** - This was Close Brothers' most popular product with independent dealers. Those lower monthly payments made expensive cars feel affordable, and the commission structure was particularly lucrative for dealers. If you had Close Brothers PCP, you're in the majority of potential claimants. The [PCP claims guide](/car-finance-claims/pcp-claims) has more PCP-specific detail.

**Hire Purchase (HP)** - Close Brothers also offered substantial HP finance. HP is more straightforward—you make payments and own the car at the end—but the dealer commission arrangements were identical to PCP. Same discretion over rates, same incentive to inflate, same lack of disclosure.

**Lease Purchase agreements** - Less common than PCP or HP, but Close Brothers offered these too. The commission structures and disclosure issues were the same. If you had a lease purchase agreement with Close Brothers, it's worth investigating.

**Personal loans arranged through dealers** - Some dealers presented what looked like a "personal loan" but was actually arranged with Close Brothers. If your dealer set up a Close Brothers loan for you (rather than you applying to a bank independently), the same commission issues potentially apply.

:::warning Check Your Paperwork
Look for "Close Brothers," "Close Brothers Motor Finance," "Close Motor Finance," or "Close Brothers Limited" on your finance documents. They may appear as the lender even if you thought you were dealing directly with the dealership. Old bank statements showing who you paid monthly will confirm this.

## How Much Compensation Can You Get from Close Brothers?

Let's talk realistically about compensation amounts, because this is where expectations need to be managed carefully.

The FCA estimates the industry-wide average at approximately **£700 per agreement**. That's a useful benchmark, but I need to explain what it actually represents: a statistical average across millions of agreements of all types, from all lenders, with all different circumstances. It's not a promise, not a minimum, not a target—it's just an average.

Your Close Brothers compensation will be calculated specifically for your case. It might be £300. It might be £1,500. It depends on factors unique to your agreement.

### What Determines Your Close Brothers Payout?

Let me walk through the factors that affect compensation, and explain why each one matters:

**The commission rate Close Brothers paid your dealer** - Close Brothers' commission structures varied over the years and by dealer agreement. Some dealerships had higher commission percentages than others. If your dealer had a particularly lucrative arrangement, your rate might have been inflated more significantly, resulting in higher compensation.

**Your interest rate vs what was fair** - Here's the calculation that matters: Close Brothers approved a range (let's say 7.5%-11.5%), the dealer set you at 10%, but someone with your credit profile typically got 8%. That 2% difference over 4 years on a £20,000 loan is roughly £800 in excess interest paid. That's your base compensation amount.

**Agreement length multiplier** - Close Brothers offered terms from 2 to 5 years typically. If you had a 5-year agreement, you made 60 monthly payments at that inflated rate. Someone with a 2-year agreement made only 24 payments. More payments = more overpaid interest = higher compensation. The percentage overpayment is the same, but the time multiplier increases the total.

**The size of your Close Brothers finance** - Percentage differences have bigger absolute impacts on larger loans. An inflated 2% on a £30,000 premium car PCP costs you more in pounds (though the same in percentage terms) than on a £12,000 used car. Close Brothers financed everything from small hatchbacks to luxury SUVs—compensation reflects that range.

**Statutory interest on top** - Any compensation you're awarded also earns 8% per year from when you overpaid until when it's repaid to you. This isn't trivial—it can add 20-30% to the total. On an £800 base settlement, statutory interest might add another £160-200.

:::keytakeaway Example: Real Close Brothers Calculation
David had an £18,000 PCP with Close Brothers in 2017 at 11.5% APR over 4 years. Investigation revealed his dealer had discretion to offer 8%-12.5%, and chose 11.5% to maximize commission. Analysis showed a fair rate for David's credit would've been 9%. He overpaid approximately £850 in interest. Add 8% statutory interest (roughly £180), and his total Close Brothers compensation: £1,030. Above the £700 average due to the significant rate inflation.
:::

### What About Multiple Close Brothers Agreements?

This is where Close Brothers claims can really add up, and it's more common than you might think.

Close Brothers financed a lot of vehicles over those years. If you upgraded cars regularly, you might have had Close Brothers finance on multiple occasions. Maybe a car in 2015, another in 2018, and one more in 2020. Each agreement had its own inflated rate, its own commission arrangements, its own overpayments.

**You can claim on every single one.** The claims are assessed separately (each agreement is its own case), but you can submit them together. Three Close Brothers agreements averaging £700 each = £2,100 total compensation potential.

### Managing Expectations Honestly

I need to be straight with you about something: not every Close Brothers claim will succeed, and not every successful claim will hit that £700 average.

**Claims may be rejected if:** Close Brothers can prove they adequately disclosed commission arrangements and obtained your informed consent. This is rare for 2007-2021 agreements, but it does happen. Some dealers did disclose commission (though usually inadequately).

**Compensation may be lower if:** The rate inflation was minimal (your rate was only slightly higher than fair), the agreement was short (less time overpaying), or partial disclosure occurred (reducing the unfairness).

**Compensation may be higher if:** Multiple agreements, significant rate inflation, clear evidence of zero disclosure, or you had high-value vehicle finance.

The point isn't to promise everyone gets £700. The point is: if you had Close Brothers finance during 2007-2021 and weren't properly informed about commission, you have a legitimate claim worth investigating—whatever the amount turns out to be.

## The Close Brothers Supreme Court Significance

Let me explain why Close Brothers being specifically involved in the 2025 Supreme Court case makes your claim stronger—it's not just a trivia point, it's legally significant.

### What the Supreme Court Actually Examined

The case involved multiple consumers who'd taken out motor finance and later discovered they'd been charged more than necessary due to undisclosed commission arrangements. Close Brothers Motor Finance was one of the named lenders whose practices were examined in detail.

The court looked at:
- How Close Brothers' commission structures worked
- What discretion dealers had over interest rates
- What consumers were actually told about these arrangements
- Whether the relationships created were "fair" under Consumer Credit Act 1974

**Their conclusion:** Certain commission arrangements (like those Close Brothers used) did constitute unfair relationships, particularly where adequate disclosure was absent. This wasn't a close call—the court was clear that earning commission by influencing rates required informed consent that typically wasn't obtained.

### What This Precedent Means for Your Claim

When you make a claim against Close Brothers now, you're not arguing in a legal vacuum. You're citing established Supreme Court precedent that specifically examined their practices.

**Practically, this means:**

**Close Brothers can't pretend the issue doesn't exist** - They were named defendants in a Supreme Court case they partially lost. They know their commission practices during 2007-2021 have been legally scrutinized and found wanting.

**Your claim has solid legal foundation** - You're not just saying "I think this was unfair." You're referencing the highest court in the UK agreeing that Close Brothers' commission arrangements created unfair relationships.

**Assessment must be fair** - Close Brothers can't just blanket-reject claims hoping you'll give up. The Supreme Court ruling means they need to properly assess each claim against the established precedent.

This doesn't guarantee your specific claim will succeed—you still need to show you meet the criteria—but it means you're standing on very solid legal ground when you make it.

## How to Claim Against Close Brothers Motor Finance

Right, you understand the issue, you think you're eligible, you're wondering what actually happens next. Let me walk you through the process step by step, because knowing what's coming removes a lot of the anxiety.

### Step 1: Gather Your Basic Information

I know this sounds like it'll be complicated, but honestly, you need surprisingly little to get started:

**Essential details:**
- Roughly when did you have Close Brothers finance? (Year is fine, exact dates not needed)
- What car was it? (Make and model, or registration if you remember)
- Where did you buy it? (Dealership name if you recall)

**That's genuinely it.** You might be thinking "but what about my finance agreement, my payment records, my credit report?" Close Brothers has all of that on file. They're legally required to keep records for years. As part of the claims process, they pull your file from their archives.

Many people don't claim because they think "I've lost all my paperwork so I can't prove anything." You don't need to prove it—Close Brothers has the proof in their own records. They just need enough information to find your account, and vehicle details plus approximate dates are sufficient.

### Step 2: Decide How to Claim

You've got two legitimate routes here, and I want to explain both fairly because this is your decision:

**Route A: Claim yourself directly (free)** - You can write to Close Brothers yourself at their head office:

Close Brothers Motor Finance  
10 Crown Place  
London EC2A 4FT

Explain you're making a claim for undisclosed commission arrangements under the Consumer Credit Act 1974, reference the Supreme Court ruling from August 2025, and request information about any commission paid to the dealer who arranged your finance. Ask for compensation reflecting your overpayment.

**What this involves:** Writing formal letters, following up on responses, potentially requesting information under data protection law, calculating what you're owed, negotiating settlement amounts, and escalating to the Financial Ombudsman if rejected. Totally doable if you're comfortable with this type of process.

**Route B: Use our no win, no fee service** - We handle everything I just described. We know exactly what Close Brothers needs because we've submitted hundreds of claims to them. We reference the Supreme Court case prominently (they're well aware of it), we cite the appropriate legal framework, and we negotiate from experience.

**What this involves for you:** Provide basic information, answer a few questions, then wait for updates while we handle the back-and-forth with Close Brothers. If they reject, we escalate to the Ombudsman. You only pay our 30% + VAT fee if we successfully recover compensation.

Neither route is wrong. It depends whether you'd rather invest time (free) or pay a fee for professional handling (no win, no fee).

### Step 3: Close Brothers Responds

Once your claim is submitted (by you or us), Close Brothers has 8 weeks to investigate and respond. Here's what happens during those 8 weeks:

They pull your file from their archives. Every Close Brothers agreement is stored—your application, credit check results, the rate you were offered, records of what commission was paid to your dealer, copies of any disclosure documents you signed.

They review what disclosure occurred. This is the key question: were you adequately informed about commission arrangements? They'll look for evidence you were told the dealer had discretion over your rate and would earn more by setting it higher. For most 2007-2021 customers, this evidence doesn't exist.

They calculate potential overpayment. If they determine disclosure was inadequate, they'll calculate what rate you should have received vs what you actually paid, multiply that by your agreement term, and arrive at a compensation figure.

They respond with a decision: uphold your claim (offering compensation), reject it (explaining why), or partially uphold (offering less than you requested).

### Step 4: Negotiation or Escalation

**If Close Brothers upholds your claim:** They'll make an offer. The question is whether that offer is fair.

Sometimes lenders offer the full calculated amount immediately—you accept, they process payment, done. Other times they offer less than seems appropriate. Maybe they calculate you overpaid £900, but they offer £600. This is where negotiation comes in.

If you're claiming yourself, you'd need to counter-offer with justification: "Your calculation seems to underestimate the rate differential. Here's why I believe £900 is appropriate..." This requires understanding the math and being comfortable pushing back.

If we're handling your claim, we negotiate this based on experience with hundreds of Close Brothers settlements. We know what they're likely to accept, where they're lowballing, and when it's worth escalating rather than accepting a low offer.

**If Close Brothers rejects your claim:** Don't assume that's the end. Many rejected claims succeed at the Financial Ombudsman level.

You can escalate to the [Financial Ombudsman Service](https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/) for free. They investigate independently, they're not influenced by Close Brothers' interests, and their decision is binding on Close Brothers. If the Ombudsman says you're owed £1,200, Close Brothers must pay it—no further negotiation.

The Ombudsman process takes longer (6-9 months typically), but it often results in better outcomes than direct claims. We handle this escalation as part of our service if your claim initially fails.

### Step 5: Receiving Your Compensation

When your Close Brothers claim succeeds, payment typically arrives within 4-6 weeks of settlement being agreed.

**If you claimed yourself:** Close Brothers pays you directly. The full compensation amount goes to you—no deductions, no fees. You keep 100%.

**If you used our service:** Close Brothers pays us. We deduct our fee (30% + VAT), then send you your 70% portion within a few days. You'll receive a clear breakdown: total compensation awarded, our fee calculation, your net amount. Full transparency.

Either way, you're getting money back that you overpaid years ago—money that was sitting in Close Brothers' accounts earning them interest while you didn't even know you were overcharged.

## How Long Do Close Brothers Claims Take?

Let me give you realistic timelines based on what we've seen across hundreds of Close Brothers claims. Not best-case, not worst-case—typical timelines so you can set proper expectations.

Most Close Brothers claims take **3-5 months** from start to finish for straightforward cases. That might seem long when you're eager for your money, but there's a process that has to unfold, and it's worth understanding why each stage takes the time it does.

### The Typical Journey (3-4 Months Direct)

**Weeks 1-2:** You (or we) submit the claim to Close Brothers. They log it in their system, assign it to their complaints team, and send an acknowledgment letter. This usually happens within a week.

**Weeks 3-10:** Close Brothers investigates. They pull your file from archives (if it's an old agreement, this can take a few days), review commission records, check disclosure documents, and calculate potential overpayment. The FCA requires them to respond within 8 weeks, and they typically use most of that time. Don't panic if you don't hear anything for 6-7 weeks—they're working through their process.

**Weeks 11-14:** If they uphold your claim, there might be brief negotiation on the amount. If they reject, you decide whether to escalate. If you accept their offer, they process settlement.

**Weeks 15-18:** Payment gets processed through Close Brothers' finance department. This typically takes 4-6 weeks from acceptance to money hitting your account.

**Total realistic timeline:** 3-4 months for claims that succeed at the lender level without complications.

### Via Claims Management Company (4-5 Months)

The timeline is similar, but there's slightly more upfront work on our end:

**Month 1:** We verify your details, confirm your Close Brothers account, request full documentation, and prepare a comprehensive professionally-argued claim. This prep work takes a bit longer than a simple DIY letter, but it increases success chances.

**Months 2-3:** Close Brothers' 8-week assessment period, same as DIY route. We're chasing them if they're slow, providing additional information they request, and maintaining pressure for timely response.

**Month 4:** Negotiation phase. If they offer £600 and we think you're owed £900 based on similar Close Brothers cases, we push back with detailed justification. Our experience with Close Brothers settlements means we know what's reasonable vs what's lowballing.

**Month 5:** Settlement processed and payment forwarded to you after our fee deduction.

**Total realistic timeline:** 16-20 weeks with professional handling.

### Financial Ombudsman Route (6-12 Months)

If Close Brothers rejects your claim and you escalate:

**Months 1-2:** Initial claim to Close Brothers, assessment, rejection.

**Month 3:** We (or you) submit the case to the Financial Ombudsman. They acknowledge receipt and assign an adjudicator. You're given a case reference number.

**Months 4-5:** The Ombudsman requests information from both sides. They want your complete story, Close Brothers' full response, all relevant documents, evidence of what disclosure occurred.

**Months 6-9:** Investigation period. An adjudicator reviews everything, may ask follow-up questions, and starts forming a view. They're looking at this fresh, unbiased by lender interests.

**Months 10-12:** Decision issued. The adjudicator proposes an outcome—if both sides accept, it becomes final. If either side disputes, a senior Ombudsman reviews and makes a binding decision.

**Total timeline:** 6-12 months, but with independent assessment and binding outcome. Many rejected Close Brothers claims succeed at this level.

### Why Some Close Brothers Claims Take Longer

**Multiple agreements** - If you're claiming on three different Close Brothers finance deals, they assess each one separately. This doesn't triple the timeline, but it does extend it—maybe 5-6 months rather than 3-4.

**Missing documentation** - Occasionally Close Brothers has trouble locating very old agreements in their archives, especially if they acquired another lender's book of business and records weren't fully integrated. This can add 4-6 weeks while they dig through systems.

**High claim volumes** - Right now, Close Brothers is receiving substantial numbers of claims following the Supreme Court case. They've set up dedicated teams, but volume still creates processing queues. Be patient—your claim is in the system.

**Complex commission structures** - Some dealership agreements with Close Brothers had tiered or variable commission structures that require more detailed analysis. These take longer to calculate accurately.

## Close Brothers vs Other Major Lenders

You might be wondering: is claiming against Close Brothers any different than claiming against Black Horse, Santander, or other lenders? Let me compare:

### Close Brothers' Unique Characteristics

**Supreme Court precedent** - This is the big differentiator. Close Brothers was specifically named in the 2025 case. When you claim against Black Horse or Santander, you're citing general principles. When you claim against Close Brothers, you're citing a case they were actually involved in. That's powerful.

**Independent lender focus** - Unlike Black Horse (owned by Lloyds) or manufacturer finance arms (BMW Finance, VW Finance), Close Brothers was independent and worked primarily with non-franchise dealers. This meant their dealer relationships and commission structures were often different—sometimes more aggressive because independent dealers had fewer constraints.

**Market position** - Close Brothers is large but not the largest (Black Horse holds that position). This affects claim processing: they have dedicated teams but not the massive infrastructure of the biggest lenders. Response times are typically industry-standard.

**Historical practices** - Each lender had slightly different commission structures and disclosure practices. Close Brothers' specific arrangements were examined in the Supreme Court case, giving us detailed insight into how they operated during the DCA period.

### Comparison Table

| Factor | Close Brothers | Black Horse | Santander |
|--------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Market position** | Large independent | Largest (Lloyds-owned) | Large bank-owned |
| **Supreme Court** | Named defendant | Not named | Not named |
| **Typical agreements** | Independent dealers | All dealer types | All dealer types |
| **Claim strength** | Very strong (precedent) | Strong (volume) | Strong (reputation) |
| **Processing time** | Standard (8 weeks) | Standard (8 weeks) | Standard (8 weeks) |

**Bottom line:** If you had Close Brothers finance, the Supreme Court involvement gives your claim a particularly strong legal foundation. That doesn't mean Close Brothers claims automatically succeed—you still need to meet eligibility criteria—but the legal precedent is especially robust.

## The FCA Redress Scheme and Close Brothers

The FCA's proposed redress scheme launching in May 2026 will significantly impact how Close Brothers processes claims going forward. Let me explain what changes:

### What the Scheme Means for Close Brothers Customers

Under the FCA's proposals, Close Brothers (like all lenders) will be required to follow a standardized assessment framework. Currently, lenders have some discretion in how they assess claims. From May 2026, the FCA mandates specific methodologies.

**The "presumption of harm" rule** - If Close Brothers' disclosure of commission arrangements was inadequate, there's a presumption you suffered financial loss. Close Brothers must then prove either that disclosure was adequate, or that you suffered no loss despite inadequate disclosure. That's a high bar to clear, and for most 2007-2021 agreements, they won't be able to clear it.

**Standardized calculations** - The FCA will prescribe how compensation is calculated. What interest rate should've applied? How is overpayment determined? What about statutory interest? Currently, lenders use different approaches. The scheme standardizes this, creating consistency.

**Systematic processing** - Rather than handling claims as they trickle in, Close Brothers will be required to proactively identify affected customers and process claims systematically. This should, in theory, speed things up and ensure no one gets overlooked.

### Should You Wait for May 2026 or Claim Now?

I get this question constantly, and my answer is always the same: **claim now, don't wait.**

Here's why: claims submitted before the scheme launches will be assessed under the scheme once it begins. You're not creating a separate "pre-scheme claim" that becomes invalid. You're submitting your claim early, and it'll be processed under the scheme's standardized framework when that framework activates.

Think of the scheme like a new set of rules for a game that's already being played. Your claim doesn't get disqualified because you started playing before the new rules—the new rules apply to your claim when they take effect.

**Advantages of claiming now:**
- You're in the system before potential deadlines
- You're at the front of the queue when systematic processing begins
- Your claim gets logged with Close Brothers immediately
- If the scheme includes any "claim by" dates, you're already in
- No disadvantage waiting months while the money sits in their account

## Frequently Asked Questions About Close Brothers Claims

### Can I claim if I've already paid off my Close Brothers finance?

Absolutely yes. Having finished paying makes zero difference to your eligibility. You're claiming about how the finance was sold—specifically, that commission arrangements weren't disclosed. Whether you finished paying last month, last year, or five years ago is irrelevant. The mis-selling occurred during the agreement period, and you're entitled to compensation for it regardless of current status.

### What if I had multiple Close Brothers agreements?

Even better—you can claim on each one individually. If you had Close Brothers PCP in 2015, 2018, and 2020 (not uncommon if you were upgrading cars regularly), that's three separate claims. Each agreement had its own interest rate, its own commission structure, its own overpayments. You don't have to choose which one to claim on—claim on all of them.

### What if I can't remember if it was definitely Close Brothers?

Check old bank statements to see who you paid monthly. The name "Close Brothers," "Close Motor Finance," or "Close Brothers Motor Finance" will appear on every payment. If you used mobile banking and still have the app, scroll back through old transactions.

Can't find statements? Your credit report (free from Experian, Equifax, or ClearScore) shows historical credit agreements, usually with the lender name and dates. That'll confirm whether it was Close Brothers.

Still stuck? If you know which dealership you bought from and roughly when, we can often identify whether they used Close Brothers for finance during that period. Dealers typically had primary lenders they worked with.

### Will claiming affect my credit score?

No, and this is a really common worry that stops people claiming unnecessarily. Making a compensation claim is not a credit application. It doesn't touch your credit file. It won't affect your credit score, even slightly.

Even if you currently have active finance with Close Brothers (maybe a different, newer agreement), claiming for a historical agreement doesn't impact your current one or your credit rating. These are entirely separate matters.

### How do I know Close Brothers will actually pay if my claim succeeds?

Close Brothers is a major financial institution listed on the London Stock Exchange. They're FCA-regulated, financially stable, and legally obligated to honor valid compensation claims. If your claim is upheld (either by them directly or by the Financial Ombudsman), they will pay. They don't have a choice—it's a legal obligation.

The Supreme Court case and FCA redress scheme mean Close Brothers is fully aware they'll be paying substantial compensation across their affected customer base. This isn't news to them—they've been preparing for it.

### What if Close Brothers says they disclosed the commission?

This is the key battleground in most claims. Close Brothers might argue "we mentioned commission in the documents" or "the customer signed acknowledgments." But the Supreme Court set a high bar: mere mention isn't enough. Informed consent requires clear explanation of the discretionary arrangement and the conflict of interest it created.

If Close Brothers claims adequate disclosure, the question becomes: what were you actually told? A buried sentence in 20 pages of documents isn't informed consent. A checkbox saying "I acknowledge commission may be payable" isn't informed consent. The Supreme Court said consumers needed to understand dealers would earn MORE by charging them MORE—that specific conflict of interest.

Most Close Brothers disclosure during 2007-2021 fell far short of this standard, which is why claims are succeeding.

### Can I claim if my Close Brothers agreement is still active?

Yes. Having ongoing Close Brothers finance doesn't prevent you from claiming about how it was sold. Your payments continue as normal—you're not disputing the debt, you're claiming the arrangement was unfair.

Some people worry "if I claim, will Close Brothers make my life difficult with my current payments?" They can't. You're exercising legal consumer rights. Your active agreement is a separate contractual matter from your compensation claim.

### What happens if Close Brothers offers me a settlement but I think it's too low?

You're not obligated to accept Close Brothers' first offer. If they offer £500 and you believe you're owed £900, you can reject the offer and counter with justification.

If claiming yourself, you'd explain why their calculation seems wrong: "You've assessed my fair rate at 9%, but similar credit profiles got 8% during that period. Recalculating at 8% gives overpayment of £850, not £500."

If we're handling your claim, we negotiate based on benchmarks from similar cases. We know from experience what Close Brothers typically pays in various scenarios, so we can assess whether their offer is fair or needs challenging.

If negotiations don't resolve it, escalating to the Financial Ombudsman gives you an independent assessment.
