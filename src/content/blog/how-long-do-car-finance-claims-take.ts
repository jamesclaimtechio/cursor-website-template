You've decided to claim for your mis-sold car finance, you've gathered your information, and now you're asking the question everyone asks: "How long is this actually going to take?" You've got bills to pay, maybe you're counting on the compensation for something specific, and "it takes as long as it takes" isn't a helpful answer.

Let me give you realistic timelines based on thousands of car finance claims we've seen processed. Not best-case scenarios that'll disappoint you, not worst-case that'll scare you—actual typical timelines so you can set proper expectations.

## How Long Do Car Finance Claims Take? (Quick Answer)

Most car finance claims take **3 to 5 months** from start to finish for straightforward cases. Direct lender claims typically resolve in 12-16 weeks, while claims via management companies average 16-20 weeks. If escalated to the Financial Ombudsman Service, the full process takes 6-12 months. The FCA redress scheme launching May 2026 may streamline future claims processing.

That's the quick answer. Now let me break down exactly what happens during those months, because understanding the process helps you stay patient when you're waiting for your money.

## Timeline for Direct Lender Claims (3-4 Months)

Let's walk through what happens when you claim directly with your lender—week by week, so you know what's happening when.

### Month 1: Claim Submission and Investigation Starts

**Week 1:** You submit your car finance claim letter to your lender (Black Horse, Close Brothers, Santander, whoever it was). You send it recorded delivery, you get proof of receipt, they acknowledge within a few days. Your claim gets logged in their complaints system and assigned to an assessor.

Behind the scenes this week: Your claim is being routed. Large lenders like Black Horse have dedicated motor finance complaints teams. Your claim gets assigned to someone in that team—let's call them your assessor. They open your file in the system.

**Week 2:** Your assessor requests your original finance agreement from archives. This isn't always instant—agreements from 2007-2015 might be in older systems, or stored with third-party archive companies. For recent agreements (2016-2021), retrieval is usually quicker.

They're also pulling commission records. Every finance agreement has associated data about what commission was paid to the dealer. This data exists—it's just in their financial systems rather than your customer-facing records.

**Weeks 3-4:** Your assessor reviews everything. They're looking at: what rate you paid, what rate ranges were offered to dealers for customers with your credit profile during that period, what disclosure documents you signed, whether commission was mentioned anywhere.

This isn't quick because they're dealing with hundreds of claims simultaneously. Yours is in a queue. They work through it systematically, but it takes time.

### Month 2: Assessment Period Continues

**Weeks 5-6:** If your lender needs additional information, they'll contact you. Maybe they need clarification on dates, or confirmation of the dealer's name, or copies of correspondence you had with the dealer. Respond promptly—delays in providing information extend the overall timeline.

Some lenders are better at communicating than others during this period. Black Horse tends to acknowledge they're still investigating. Smaller lenders might go silent until the 8-week mark.

**Weeks 7-8:** The assessment reaches conclusion. Your assessor has reviewed all evidence, calculated potential overpayment (if applicable), and formulated their recommendation: uphold, reject, or partial uphold.

The Financial Conduct Authority requires lenders to respond within 8 weeks of receiving complaints. Most use close to that full time. Some respond at week 6, others right at the 8-week deadline. Don't panic if you haven't heard anything by week 6—they're likely working through their process.

**Your response arrives:** Typically week 8-9. You'll receive either a detailed letter or email explaining their decision. If upheld: they'll offer a compensation amount with calculation breakdown. If rejected: they'll explain why they believe no mis-selling occurred. If partial: they'll offer less than you claimed with justification.

### Month 3: Negotiation or Acceptance

**Weeks 9-10:** You decide how to respond to the lender's offer or rejection.

**If they upheld and the amount seems fair:** You accept. Settlement processing begins. Skip to month 4.

**If they upheld but offered less than expected:** You can counter-offer with justification. "Your calculation assesses my fair rate at 9%, but similar credit profiles during that period qualified for 7.5%. At 7.5%, my overpayment is £850, not the £600 you're offering." This negotiation can take 2-4 weeks of back-and-forth.

**If they rejected:** You decide whether to accept their rejection or escalate to the Financial Ombudsman Service (free). Escalation adds 6-8 months to the timeline but often succeeds where direct claims failed. More on this route later.

**Weeks 11-12:** If you negotiated, hopefully you've reached agreed compensation amount. If you accepted initial offer, settlement is processing.

### Month 4: Payment Processing and Receipt

**Weeks 13-16:** The lender processes your car finance claim compensation payment. This goes through their finance department (they need internal approvals, compliance checks, payment authorizations). It's administrative but necessary.

**Week 16-18:** Payment arrives in your bank account. Direct bank transfer typically. You receive the full compensation amount (if claiming yourself—no deductions for fees).

**Total typical timeline for direct claims: 12-18 weeks (3-4 months)** if the claim succeeds at lender level without complications.

:::keytakeaway Why It Takes This Long
The 8-week lender response time isn't arbitrary—it's an FCA requirement giving lenders reasonable time to investigate properly. They're pulling years-old records, reviewing disclosure standards from that period, and calculating overpayments. Rushed assessments lead to errors. The time exists for thorough, fair assessment.
:::

## Timeline via Claims Management Company (4-5 Months)

If you use a professional service like ours, the overall timeline is similar but with slightly more upfront work on our end. Let me walk you through what happens:

### Month 1: Preparation and Submission

**Week 1:** You complete eligibility check with us (2 minutes), decide to proceed, provide your basic information. We verify everything: confirm your lender, check agreement dates fall within DCA period, ensure you meet eligibility criteria.

**Week 2-3:** We request your full finance agreement from the lender under data protection law. This is a formal information request they must respond to within 30 days. While waiting, we prepare your claim framework—researching your lender's specific commission structures during your period, gathering precedent cases, drafting legal arguments.

**Week 3-4:** Your agreement arrives from the lender. We review it in detail: rate you paid, terms, any disclosure documents, commission records if included. We calculate your overpayment based on fair rate comparisons.

We prepare your comprehensive claim: detailed explanation of inadequate disclosure, citations to Consumer Credit Act 1974 and Supreme Court precedent, evidence of commission arrangements, calculation of overpayment, request for compensation. This is professionally argued—not just "I want to claim," but a legal framework they must assess seriously.

**We submit your car finance claim:** Typically week 4 of the process. The lender's 8-week clock starts from this submission.

### Months 2-3: Lender Assessment

**Weeks 5-12:** The lender assesses your claim. Same 8-week process as direct claims, but with one key difference: we're chasing them if they're slow, providing additional information if they request it, maintaining pressure for timely response.

Some lenders try to extend deadlines, asking for "more time to investigate." We push back unless there's legitimate reason. The 8-week deadline exists for a purpose.

**Week 12-13:** Lender responds. If they uphold, we review their offer against similar cases we've handled. If it's fair, we recommend acceptance. If it's low, we prepare counter-arguments.

If they reject, we don't accept that as final. We review rejection reasoning, assess strength of Ombudsman appeal, discuss options with you.

### Month 4: Negotiation

**Weeks 14-16:** If the lender's offer was below what we believe is appropriate, we negotiate. We've handled hundreds of car finance claims—we know what Black Horse typically pays for certain scenarios, what Close Brothers considers reasonable, what arguments work with Santander.

This negotiation might involve: presenting additional evidence, citing precedent cases with higher payouts, explaining why their calculation underestimates rate differential, or threatening Ombudsman escalation if they're being unreasonable.

**Many lenders increase initial offers when challenged professionally.** They make conservative first offers testing whether you'll accept. Professional negotiation often adds £100-300 to settlements.

### Month 5: Settlement and Payment

**Weeks 17-20:** Once compensation amount is agreed, the lender processes payment. They pay us (as your representatives), we deduct our 30% + VAT fee, and forward your 70% portion typically within 2-3 days of receiving payment from the lender.

You receive: Clear breakdown showing total compensation recovered, our fee calculation, your net amount. Everything transparent.

**Total timeline via claims management: 16-24 weeks (4-5 months)** for claims that succeed at lender level.

**The extra 4-6 weeks compared to direct claims comes from:** More thorough preparation upfront, professional negotiation taking time but often resulting in better outcomes, and payment routing through us before reaching you.

## Financial Ombudsman Route (6-12 Months)

If your lender rejects your car finance claim, or you're unhappy with their offer, you can escalate to the Financial Ombudsman Service. This is free, independent, and often successful—but it's not quick.

### Months 1-2: Initial Lender Claim

**Weeks 1-8:** You claim directly with your lender (or we do on your behalf). They investigate and ultimately reject your claim, or make an offer you consider inadequate.

**You receive their "final response"**—this is important language. You need the lender's "final response letter" to escalate to the Ombudsman. This explicitly says they've concluded their investigation and this is their final position.

### Month 3: Ombudsman Case Setup

**Week 9:** You (or we) submit your case to the Financial Ombudsman Service. This can be done online at financial-ombudsman.org.uk, by post, or by phone. You need your lender's final response letter and your case details.

**Week 10:** The Ombudsman sends acknowledgment. You get a case reference number. They explain their process and estimated timelines. They assign an adjudicator to your case.

**Week 11-12:** The Ombudsman contacts your lender, informing them the case has been escalated. They request the lender's full file: your agreement, commission records, correspondence, their reasoning for rejection.

### Months 4-5: Information Gathering

**Weeks 13-16:** The Ombudsman reviews everything submitted. They might have follow-up questions for you: "Can you clarify what the dealer told you about commission?" "Do you have any correspondence from the dealer?" "Was anything mentioned verbally even if not in documents?"

**Weeks 17-20:** They review the lender's position in detail. Why did the lender reject? What's their evidence of adequate disclosure? What's their justification for the rate offered? The adjudicator is forming an independent view.

### Months 6-9: Investigation and Assessment

**This is the long bit.** The Ombudsman isn't rushing—they're examining everything thoroughly. They're looking at your car finance claim with completely fresh eyes, uninfluenced by the lender's interests.

**What they're assessing:**
- Was disclosure adequate? (comparing what you were told vs what the Supreme Court says is required)
- Was the rate fair? (comparing your rate vs rates for similar credit profiles)
- Did you suffer financial loss? (calculating overpayment if disclosure was inadequate)
- What's appropriate compensation? (if they uphold your claim)

**The adjudicator might:** Request more information from both parties, ask for specific documents, question the lender's arguments, or seek expert opinion on technical aspects.

**Communication during this period is minimal.** You won't hear much for months. This is normal—they're working through it systematically. No news doesn't mean nothing is happening.

### Months 10-12: Decision and Outcome

**Week 36-40:** The adjudicator issues their provisional assessment. This is their view on your car finance claim. They share it with both parties. You can accept it, and the lender must accept it (binding on them). Or you can reject it and request a final Ombudsman decision.

**Week 41-44:** If either party rejects the provisional assessment, an Ombudsman (senior to the adjudicator) reviews everything and makes a final decision. This decision is binding on the lender but not on you—you can reject it and go to court if you want (though courts are expensive and most people accept Ombudsman decisions).

**Week 45-48:** If the Ombudsman upholds your claim, the lender processes payment. They typically have 28 days to pay from the decision date. Payment arrives either to you directly (if you handled it yourself) or via your claims management company (who deduct their fee and forward your portion).

**Total timeline with Ombudsman escalation: 6-12 months** depending on case complexity and whether provisional assessment is accepted or final review is needed.

**Is it worth the extra 6-8 months?** Often yes. The Ombudsman's success rate for car finance claims is significantly higher than lender success rates. Many rejected claims succeed at Ombudsman level. Plus, Ombudsman awards are often higher than lender initial offers—they're not influenced by the lender's desire to minimize payouts.

## What Affects How Long Car Finance Claims Take?

Not all car finance claims take the same time. Let me explain what makes some resolve quickly while others drag on:

### Factors That Speed Up Claims

**Simple, single agreement** - One PCP or HP agreement, straightforward circumstances, clear dates. Lenders can assess these quickly because there's less to review. Timeline: often toward the faster end (3 months rather than 5).

**Recent agreements** - Car finance from 2016-2021 has documentation in modern systems. Easy to retrieve, clear records. Older agreements (2007-2012) might be archived in legacy systems requiring more time to access.

**Clear lack of disclosure** - If the lender's own records show zero commission disclosure, they can't really argue against your claim. Assessment is quicker because the evidence is straightforward. Many of these settle at initial offer stage without negotiation.

**Cooperative lenders** - Some lenders have efficient, well-resourced complaints teams. They process car finance claims systematically and hit deadlines consistently. Black Horse and Santander tend to be relatively efficient. Your timeline with efficient lenders is more predictable.

**All paperwork available** - If you (or we) can provide the original finance agreement, it saves the lender time retrieving it from archives. Shaves maybe a week off the timeline.

### Factors That Slow Down Claims

**Multiple finance agreements** - Claiming on three different car finance deals means three separate assessments. Even if they're with the same lender, each agreement gets reviewed individually. This doesn't triple the timeline, but it extends it—maybe 5-6 months rather than 3-4.

**Complex commission structures** - Some dealer agreements with lenders had tiered commission, volume bonuses, or manufacturer incentive programs. These require detailed analysis. The more complex the commission structure, the longer assessment takes.

**Missing documentation** - If the lender has trouble finding your records (perhaps they acquired another company's book and records weren't fully integrated), retrieval can take weeks rather than days. Adds 4-6 weeks to the timeline occasionally.

**High claim volumes** - Right now, lenders are receiving thousands of car finance claims. Some have scaled up their teams to handle volume. Others are overwhelmed. If your lender has a massive backlog, your claim sits in queue longer. Unfortunately, this is outside your control.

**Partial disclosure arguments** - If the lender argues "we mentioned commission on page 17, paragraph 4," and you need to counter-argue "that's not adequate disclosure," it becomes more contentious. Contentious cases take longer to resolve than clear-cut ones.

**Lender delaying tactics** - Some lenders try to extend deadlines, claiming they need "more time to investigate." They might request the same information multiple times, or ask increasingly detailed questions. This is sometimes legitimate, sometimes strategy to slow things down. Professional claims companies push back on unnecessary delays—individual claimants might not know when delays are unreasonable.

:::warning The 8-Week Rule Isn't Always 8 Weeks
While the FCA requires lenders to respond within 8 weeks, they can sometimes extend this if they have legitimate reasons (complex case, high volumes, missing records). In practice, some car finance claims take 10-12 weeks for lender response rather than 8. Frustrating, but sometimes unavoidable.

## Lender-Specific Timelines for Car Finance Claims

Different lenders process car finance claims at different speeds. Let me give you realistic expectations based on what we've seen:

### Black Horse Finance Claims

**Typical timeline: 3-4 months**

Black Horse is the UK's largest motor finance lender, and they've developed relatively efficient processes for handling car finance claims. They receive the highest volume of claims, so they've invested in dedicated teams.

**What we've observed:** Black Horse often responds within 6-7 weeks rather than using the full 8. Their initial offers tend to be fair (though negotiation still sometimes yields better results). Settlement processing is usually 4-5 weeks after acceptance.

**Quirk:** Black Horse sometimes requests additional information even when it seems unnecessary. Respond promptly to keep your claim moving.

### Close Brothers Motor Finance Claims

**Typical timeline: 3-5 months**

Close Brothers was named in the Supreme Court case, so they're acutely aware of scrutiny. They tend to assess claims carefully—which means thoroughly, but not always quickly.

**What we've observed:** Close Brothers uses close to the full 8-week assessment period. They're systematic rather than fast. However, their decisions tend to be well-reasoned—clear explanations whether upholding or rejecting. Settlement processing is efficient once amount is agreed (3-4 weeks).

**Quirk:** Close Brothers often makes initial offers below what negotiation yields. Be prepared to counter-offer (or have your claims company do so).

Learn more: [Close Brothers Motor Finance Claims](/car-finance-claims/close-brothers-motor-finance-claims)

### Santander Car Finance Claims

**Typical timeline: 4-5 months**

Santander's motor finance complaints are handled through their Consumer Finance division. As a large bank with established processes, they're systematic but not necessarily fast.

**What we've observed:** Santander tends to use the full 8 weeks, sometimes slightly more if they have high volumes. Their responses are detailed and procedural. Settlement processing can take 5-6 weeks as payments go through multiple approval layers in a bank structure.

**Quirk:** Santander sometimes separates motor finance claims from other banking queries. Make absolutely clear your claim relates to car finance specifically, not banking products, to ensure correct routing.

### Smaller Lenders (MotoNovo, Moneybarn, etc.)

**Typical timeline: 4-6 months**

Smaller or specialist lenders often have less developed complaints processes. Not because they're trying to delay—they just don't have the same team resources as Black Horse or Santander.

**What we've observed:** Response times vary significantly. Some are quick (6 weeks), others need extensions (10-12 weeks). Settlement processing can be slower without dedicated payment systems for complaints.

**Consideration:** These lenders often settle fairly to avoid Ombudsman escalation costs. They're not trying to fight every claim—they just process them slower due to resource constraints.

## Timeline for Different Claim Types

The type of car finance claim affects processing time. Let me break down typical timelines by claim type:

### PCP Claims Timeline

**Average: 4 months**

PCP claims often take slightly longer because the agreement structure is more complex. Assessors need to consider balloon payments, depreciation calculations, early settlement figures. The math is more involved than straightforward HP.

However, PCP claims during 2007-2021 are now well-established. Lenders have seen thousands. They know the assessment process. This familiarity actually helps—they're not figuring it out from scratch.

Learn more: [PCP Claims Guide](/car-finance-claims/pcp-claims)

### HP Claims Timeline

**Average: 3-4 months**

Hire Purchase claims are sometimes marginally faster because HP is simpler: you borrow money, you pay it off over time, you own the car at the end. No balloon payments, no depreciation complexity. Straightforward interest calculation.

Assessment is more direct: what rate did you pay, what rate should you have had, what's the difference, multiply by term. Done.

### DCA Claims Timeline

**Average: 3-5 months**

DCA (Discretionary Commission Arrangement) claims are the most common type—these are claims specifically about dealers having discretion over rates without disclosure. Whether your agreement was PCP, HP, or a personal loan, if it involved DCAs, this is your claim type.

Timeline varies based on how clear the discretionary arrangement was in lender records. Some lenders kept detailed commission structures documented. Others have murkier records requiring more investigation.

Learn more: [Understanding DCAs](/car-finance-claims/understanding-discretionary-commission-arrangements)

### Mis-Selling Claims (Non-Commission)

**Average: 4-6 months**

Claims for other types of mis-selling (pressure tactics, affordability issues, unsuitable products) can take longer because they're more subjective. Commission claims are mathematical—did disclosure occur? What was the overpayment? Mis-selling claims require assessing whether conduct was inappropriate, which involves more judgment.

## The FCA Redress Scheme Timeline (From May 2026)

Let me explain how the FCA's systematic redress scheme will affect car finance claim timelines going forward:

### What Changes in May 2026

The FCA is launching a comprehensive motor finance redress scheme that requires lenders to process claims systematically and consistently. Here's what this means for timelines:

**Standardized assessment period** - Currently, lenders have "8 weeks" but can extend with justification. Under the scheme, there will be clearer deadlines with less flexibility for extensions. This should reduce the variation in response times.

**Systematic processing** - Rather than handling claims as they arrive sporadically, lenders will need to process their backlog systematically. Think of it like PPI reclaim processing—mass systematic handling rather than individual ad-hoc assessments.

**Consistent methodologies** - Right now, different lenders calculate compensation slightly differently. The scheme mandates consistent calculation methods. This should reduce negotiation time because there's less room for lenders to low-ball offers using creative math.

**Presumption of harm** - If disclosure was inadequate, there's a presumption you suffered loss. This shifts burden to lenders. Rather than you proving inadequate disclosure (which takes time gathering evidence), lenders must prove adequate disclosure. Cases resolve faster when the burden is on them rather than you.

### Expected Timeline Under the Scheme

**The FCA hasn't specified exact timelines yet**, but based on the proposals:

**Likely scenario:** 
- Acknowledgment: Within 7 days
- Investigation: 6-10 weeks (standardized period)
- Offer/decision: Week 8-12
- Settlement: 4 weeks after acceptance
- **Total: 3-4 months** for typical cases

**This is similar to current timelines**, but with more consistency. Currently, some lenders are quick (3 months) and others slow (6 months). The scheme should bring everyone to a consistent 3-4 month standard.

### Should You Wait for the Scheme to Get Faster Processing?

**My advice: Don't wait.** Here's why:

**Claims submitted now will be processed under the scheme** when it launches. You're not creating a separate claim that gets invalidated. You're submitting early, which means you're in the system when the scheme begins systematic processing.

**You'll be at the front of the queue.** May 2026 arrives, scheme launches, systematic processing begins—and your claim is already logged, investigated, and waiting. People who wait until May 2026 to submit will be behind you.

**The scheme may create deadlines.** If the FCA eventually imposes "claims must be submitted by [date]," you want to already be submitted. Getting in now protects against future deadlines.

**The money is sitting in the lender's account.** Every month you wait is another month you don't have compensation you're owed. Even if the scheme speeds things up marginally, the months spent waiting cancel that benefit.

## Can You Speed Up Your Car Finance Claim?

This is a really common question: "Is there anything I can do to make my claim faster?" Let me be honest about what helps and what doesn't:

### What Actually Helps

**Respond promptly to information requests** - If your lender asks for clarification or additional details, respond within days, not weeks. Every day you delay is a day your claim sits in pending status rather than moving forward.

**Provide complete information upfront** - When submitting your car finance claim, include everything relevant: full dealer name and address, approximate dates, vehicle details, any paperwork you have. Complete submissions mean fewer back-and-forth requests.

**Use professional claims management** - We have established processes with major lenders. We know what they need, how to present it, and how to chase effectively. Professional handling doesn't dramatically speed things up, but it removes the delays that occur when individuals don't know the process.

**Don't make unrealistic demands** - Claims demanding excessive compensation (far beyond what's justified) take longer because lenders push back harder. Realistic claims based on actual overpayment settle faster.

### What Doesn't Help (Despite What You Might Think)

**Calling the lender repeatedly** - Complaints teams don't speed up assessment because you called three times. Your claim is in queue, it'll be assessed when reached. Excessive calls just irritate the assessor (human nature) without actually expediting anything.

**Threatening legal action** - "I'll sue if you don't pay" doesn't scare lenders—they have legal departments, this is what they deal with constantly. Empty threats don't speed anything up. Legitimate escalation to the Ombudsman is taken seriously, but threats aren't.

**Submitting multiple claims** - Some people submit the same claim multiple times thinking it'll get faster attention. It doesn't—it just creates duplicate entries that need reconciling, potentially slowing things down.

**Paying for "fast track" services** - Be wary of any claims company promising faster processing for extra fees. The lender's 8-week assessment period applies to all claims equally. No one has access to "fast track" processing that bypasses normal timelines.

**Accept:** Car finance claims take time. The timeline exists for proper investigation. Trying to short-circuit it usually just causes frustration without actually speeding anything up.

## Timeline Expectations by Agreement Type

Let me give you specific timeline expectations based on what type of car finance you had:

### PCP (Personal Contract Purchase) - 4-5 Months

**Why slightly longer:** PCP structure is complex (balloon payments, depreciation, early settlement calculations). Assessors need time to work through the math. However, PCP claims are now well-established—lenders have processed thousands, so there's familiarity that helps.

**Typical breakdown:**
- Investigation: 8-9 weeks (slightly longer due to complexity)
- Negotiation: 2-3 weeks (PCP math is detailed, justifying amounts takes time)
- Settlement: 4-6 weeks (standard)

**If you have PCP:** Expect 4-5 months. Plan accordingly.

### HP (Hire Purchase) - 3-4 Months

**Why sometimes faster:** HP is straightforward. Borrow money, pay it off, own the car. Interest calculation is simple. Overpayment calculation is clearer.

**Typical breakdown:**
- Investigation: 6-8 weeks (simpler structure = faster assessment)
- Negotiation: 1-2 weeks (less complexity = less to argue about)
- Settlement: 4-5 weeks (standard)

**If you have HP:** Expect 3-4 months. Potentially one of the quicker claim types.

### Multiple Agreements - 5-6 Months

**Why longer:** Each agreement requires separate assessment even if with same lender. Your Black Horse PCP from 2015, Black Horse HP from 2017, and Black Horse PCP from 2019 are three distinct cases. The lender needs to pull three sets of records, review three commission arrangements, calculate three overpayments.

**Typical breakdown:**
- Investigation: 10-12 weeks (assessing multiple agreements)
- Negotiation: 3-4 weeks (multiple amounts to agree)
- Settlement: 4-6 weeks (processing multiple payments)

**If you have multiple:** Expect 5-6 months. But remember—you're recovering compensation for all agreements, so the total amount makes the extra time worthwhile.

### Old Agreements (2007-2012) - 4-6 Months

**Why sometimes longer:** Really old agreements might be in archived systems. Commission records from 15 years ago require more effort to retrieve. Some lenders have changed computer systems multiple times since 2007—data migration means records are findable but not instantly.

**Typical breakdown:**
- Investigation: 8-12 weeks (longer for archive retrieval)
- Negotiation: 2-3 weeks (standard)
- Settlement: 4-6 weeks (standard)

**If your claim is for pre-2013 finance:** Expect toward the longer end of timelines. The wait is usually about record retrieval, not assessment difficulty.

## What Happens After You Submit Your Claim?

Let me walk you through what's actually happening during those months when you're waiting, because understanding the process helps you stay patient:

### Weeks 1-2: Receipt and Routing

Your car finance claim arrives at the lender (by post, email, or via online portal). It gets logged in their complaints management system—every claim gets a unique reference number.

The system routes it to the appropriate team. Motor finance complaints go to specialist teams who handle nothing else. Your claim lands in an assessor's queue.

**What you see:** Acknowledgment letter or email. Usually arrives within 3-5 days of your claim reaching them. Gives you a reference number and explains their process.

**What they're doing:** Opening your file, confirming they can find your agreement in their system, adding your claim to their assessment queue.

### Weeks 3-6: Deep Investigation

This is when the real work happens. Your assessor is:

**Retrieving your original agreement** from archives. This document has your APR, terms, any disclosure language. They need the original, not just their database summary.

**Pulling commission records** from financial systems. How much was the dealer paid for your car finance? What commission structure was in place? Was it flat-rate, percentage, tiered? All of this is documented internally.

**Reviewing disclosure standards** from your agreement period. What did their disclosure templates look like in 2016? What did training materials tell staff to explain to customers? What was their disclosure policy?

**Comparing rates** to determine what was fair for your credit profile. They'll look at: what rates did they typically offer customers with similar credit scores during that period? What was the minimum rate the dealer could've given you?

**Calculating overpayment** if they determine disclosure was inadequate. Sophisticated financial calculators determine the difference between what you paid and what you should have paid over your term.

**What you see:** Usually nothing. This is the "silent period" when you're wondering "are they even doing anything?" They are—this work just happens behind the scenes.

### Weeks 7-8: Decision Formulation

The assessor compiles their findings and formulates a decision:

**If they're upholding:** They calculate exact compensation (overpayment plus statutory interest), prepare an offer letter explaining the breakdown, and get internal approval for the payment.

**If they're rejecting:** They document why they believe disclosure was adequate, or why they think the rate was fair, or why they don't believe mis-selling occurred. This rejection needs to be justified—they can't just say "no" without reasoning.

**If they're partially upholding:** They explain which parts of your claim they accept and which they don't. Maybe they agree commission wasn't disclosed but calculate overpayment differently than you did.

**Week 8-9:** Their final response goes out to you. This is typically a detailed letter (or email) explaining their decision with full reasoning.

### Weeks 9-12: Your Response

**If you're accepting their offer:** You confirm acceptance (usually by signing and returning an acceptance form). Their settlement process begins.

**If you're negotiating:** You counter-argue why their offer is too low, ideally with evidence or comparisons to similar cases. They review your counter-offer. This adds 2-4 weeks but can increase your compensation.

**If you're escalating a rejection:** You submit to the Financial Ombudsman Service. A completely new timeline begins (6-12 months for Ombudsman route).

### Weeks 13-18: Settlement and Payment

Once compensation amount is finally agreed:

**Week 13-14:** The lender processes settlement internally. They need approval from complaints managers, finance directors, sometimes legal teams. Larger compensation amounts require more senior approvals.

**Week 15-16:** Payment gets instructed to their finance department. Banks are slow—multiple systems, compliance checks, payment runs scheduled weekly or fortnightly rather than daily.

**Week 17-18:** Money arrives in your account (or in your claims company's account if they're handling it, then forwarded to you after fee deduction).

**This feels like a long time when you're waiting for money you're owed.** But lenders are large organizations with processes, approvals, compliance requirements. The 4-6 weeks for settlement processing is genuinely how long their systems take.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Timelines

### Can I speed up my car finance claim?

Unfortunately, not really. The 8-week lender assessment period is mandated by the FCA—lenders aren't allowed to rush it because that could lead to improper assessments. Settlement processing times are driven by internal bank systems you can't influence.

What you CAN do:
- Respond promptly to any information requests (keeps things moving)
- Provide complete information upfront (reduces back-and-forth)
- Use professional claims management (we know how to chase effectively)

What you CAN'T do:
- Force lenders to assess faster (they have legal right to 8 weeks)
- Bypass settlement processing (their systems have required steps)
- Jump the queue (claims are processed in order received)

### When will I hear back about my claim?

**Initial acknowledgment:** Within 3-5 days of submission  
**Assessment decision:** Week 6-9 typically (legally up to 8 weeks)  
**Payment (if upheld and accepted):** 4-6 weeks after agreement  

**Total from submission to payment:** 12-18 weeks for straightforward claims

**Check your acknowledgment letter—it'll have an estimated response date (usually 8 weeks from receipt).**

### What happens after I submit my claim?

**Immediate:** You get acknowledgment with reference number (within days)  
**Weeks 1-8:** Lender investigates (silent period—you usually hear nothing)  
**Week 8-9:** You receive their decision (uphold, reject, or partial)  
**Weeks 9-12:** Negotiation if needed, or acceptance if offer is fair  
**Weeks 13-18:** Settlement processing and payment  

**Most communication happens at endpoints** (acknowledgment and decision). The middle period is silent while they work through assessment.

### How long does the Financial Ombudsman take?

**Total Ombudsman timeline: 6-9 months typically**

Breakdown:
- Case setup: 2-4 weeks
- Information gathering: 4-8 weeks
- Investigation: 4-6 months (this is the long bit)
- Decision: 4-8 weeks after investigation completes

**Why so long?** The Ombudsman is independent and thorough. They review everything from scratch, they're not rushing to close cases, and they have substantial volume. The thoroughness is actually good—it's why their success rate is higher than direct claims.

**Your car finance claim with the Ombudsman progresses slowly but surely.** No news for months is normal—they're working through it, just without constant updates.

### Will the FCA scheme make claims faster?

Probably marginally, but don't expect dramatic improvements. The scheme creates consistency (all lenders using similar timelines) rather than speed (all lenders processing in weeks instead of months).

**Current situation:** Some lenders respond in 6 weeks, others take 12. Settlement ranges from 3 to 8 weeks. Inconsistent.

**Under the scheme:** Most lenders should hit similar marks—8 weeks assessment, 4 weeks settlement. Consistent.

**The overall timeline (3-5 months) likely stays similar**, but the variation reduces. You'll be able to predict more accurately how long your specific claim will take.

## Managing Expectations During Your Claim

Let me give you some mindset advice for the waiting period, because this is genuinely hard for many people:

### Set It and (Try to) Forget It

The hardest part about car finance claim timelines is the waiting. You submit your claim, then... nothing. Weeks pass. You're checking email constantly. You're wondering if anything is happening.

**Here's what helps:** Once you've submitted your claim (or instructed us to handle it), try to mentally file it under "this is happening, it'll take months, I'll check in occasionally but I won't obsess."

**Why this matters:** Obsessing doesn't make it faster. Checking email hourly doesn't speed assessment. The timeline is the timeline. People who accept this at the start handle the wait better than people who expect constant updates.

**If you're using our service:** We update you at every significant milestone (claim submitted, lender responded, offer received, settlement agreed, payment sent). Between those milestones, nothing new to report means the process is progressing normally. No news is neutral, not bad.

### Understand the Silence Is Normal

**Weeks 2-7 of your car finance claim are usually silent.** This drives people crazy. You've heard nothing. You're wondering "did they even receive it? Are they doing anything? Have they forgotten?"

They received it. They're doing work. They haven't forgotten. The silence is because assessment happens internally—there's nothing to update you on until they've concluded. Imagine if they sent weekly updates: "Still investigating... Still investigating... Still investigating..." That wouldn't actually help.

**The silence ends when they have something definitive to tell you**—their decision. Usually week 8-9.

### Prepare for Possible Rejection

**Not all car finance claims succeed**, even legitimate ones. Maybe the lender has evidence of disclosure you don't remember. Maybe they argue the rate was fair for market conditions at the time. Maybe they're hoping you won't escalate.

**If your claim is rejected:** Don't immediately assume you were wrong. Many rejected claims succeed at Financial Ombudsman level. Lenders sometimes reject hoping you'll give up. The Ombudsman takes a fresh look and frequently overturns rejections.

**Point being:** The car finance claim process might not end at the lender level. Be mentally prepared for potential escalation, which adds 6-8 months. Better to expect it and be pleasantly surprised by quick settlement than expect quick settlement and be disappointed by rejection requiring escalation.

### Celebrate When It Arrives

**When your compensation finally arrives** (after 3-5 months of waiting), it's easy to think "finally, about time." But take a moment to appreciate: you recovered money that was gone. The lender wasn't going to voluntarily return it. If you hadn't claimed, that money would've stayed in their accounts forever.

Whether it's £400 or £1,200, it's money you didn't have before. Money that left your account monthly years ago for inflated interest. Getting it back, even after months of waiting, is a win.

**Car finance claims take time—but the compensation is worth the wait.**

Three to five months feels long when you're eager for money you're owed. But consider: this relates to finance you had years ago. You've already waited this long without even knowing you could claim. Another few months to recover £700+ (potentially significantly more) is manageable.

The timeline exists for proper, thorough assessment. Rushed claims lead to errors—overpayments calculated incorrectly, disclosure assessed superficially, compensation amounts wrong. The time taken is actually in your interest—it ensures you get the appropriate amount, properly calculated, with full consideration of evidence.

:::keytakeaway Be Patient But Persistent
Most car finance claims take 3-5 months. If you claim directly, stay on top of deadlines—chase if they exceed 8 weeks without response. If you use a claims management service, let them handle chasing while you get on with life. Either way, the compensation arrives eventually. Patience during the process is frustrating but necessary. The money is worth the wait.

      question: "How long does the Financial Ombudsman take?",
      answer: "The Financial Ombudsman Service typically takes 6-9 months to resolve car finance claims from escalation to final decision. This includes case setup (2-4 weeks), information gathering (4-8 weeks), investigation (4-6 months), and decision (4-8 weeks). While longer than direct lender claims, Ombudsman success rates are significantly higher."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I speed up my car finance claim?",
      answer: "You can help by responding promptly to information requests and providing complete information upfront, but you cannot significantly speed up the 8-week lender assessment period mandated by the FCA. Professional claims management helps avoid delays but doesn't bypass required processing time. The timeline exists for proper investigation."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens after I submit my claim?",
      answer: "After submitting your car finance claim, you receive acknowledgment within 3-5 days. The lender investigates for 6-8 weeks (retrieving records, reviewing commission, calculating overpayment). They respond at week 8-9 with uphold, reject, or partial offer. If upheld and accepted, payment processes over 4-6 weeks. Total typical timeline: 3-5 months."
    },
    {
      question: "When will I hear back about my claim?",
      answer: "You'll hear back from your lender within 8 weeks of submission (FCA requirement). Initial acknowledgment arrives within 3-5 days. Most lenders respond with their decision at week 6-9. If upheld and you accept, payment arrives 4-6 weeks later. Total timeline from submission to payment: typically 12-18 weeks for straightforward claims."
    },
    {
      question: "How long do PCP claims take?",
      answer: "PCP claims typically take 4-5 months from start to finish. The PCP structure is more complex than HP (balloon payments, depreciation calculations), which can extend assessment slightly. Lenders need 8-9 weeks to assess, then 2-3 weeks for negotiation, and 4-6 weeks for settlement processing. Multiple PCP agreements take 5-6 months to assess all claims."
