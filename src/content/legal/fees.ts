:::highlight[blue] Important: Our Referral Service is Free
**You do not pay any fees to Website Builder.** Our service is completely free - we assess your eligibility and refer you to specialist solicitors at no cost to you.

The fees described on this page are charged by the **solicitors we refer you to**, not by us. We receive a referral fee from the solicitor, but this does not come from your compensation and does not increase the solicitor's charges.
:::

## No Win, No Fee with Your Solicitor

The solicitors we refer you to operate on a **No Win, No Fee** basis. This means you don't pay your solicitor anything if your claim is unsuccessful. You only pay when they successfully secure compensation for you.

This arrangement removes the financial risk from pursuing a claim and ensures everyone's interests are aligned with yours.

## Solicitor Success Fee

If your claim is successful, your solicitor will charge a success fee of **up to 30% of the compensation awarded**, plus VAT (Value Added Tax at the current rate).

:::example Fee Calculation Example
- **Compensation Awarded:** £1,000.00
- **Success Fee (30%):** £300.00
- **VAT (20% on fee):** £60.00
- **You Receive:** £640.00
:::

The exact percentage will be confirmed in your Client Care Letter and Fee Agreement from your solicitor before you sign.

:::infobox[green]
**Remember:** This fee is charged by your solicitor, not by Website Builder. We do not receive any payment from your compensation.

## No Upfront Costs

Neither Website Builder nor the solicitors we refer you to charge any upfront fees. There are no costs to:

- Check if you're eligible for a claim with Website Builder
- Be referred to a solicitor
- Have your solicitor review your case
- Begin the claims process with your solicitor
- Have your solicitor communicate with lenders on your behalf

All solicitor fees are contingent on achieving a successful outcome for you.

## Additional Costs

In most cases, the only fee you'll pay is your solicitor's success fee. However, there may be additional costs in certain circumstances:

### After-The-Event (ATE) Insurance

To protect you from costs if your claim is unsuccessful, your solicitor may arrange After-The-Event insurance. If required, the cost of this insurance will be deducted from your compensation if your claim succeeds. If your claim is unsuccessful, you pay nothing.

### Termination Fees

If you decide to cancel your claim with the solicitor after the initial cooling-off period, termination fees may apply. These will be clearly stated in your solicitor's Client Care Letter. You have a 14-day cooling-off period during which you can cancel without any charges.

### Disbursements

In rare cases, there may be unavoidable third-party costs (such as court fees). If these are necessary, your solicitor will inform you in advance and seek your approval before proceeding.

## When Are Fees Paid?

You don't pay anything until your compensation is received. Once the lender or defendant pays your compensation:

:::steps
1. The full compensation amount is received by your solicitor
2. The solicitor deducts their success fee and VAT
3. The solicitor deducts any insurance premiums or other agreed costs
4. The solicitor provides you with a clear breakdown of deductions
5. The solicitor transfers the remaining compensation to your bank account
:::

## No Hidden Charges

We believe in complete transparency. Our referral service has **no charges to you**. Your solicitor's fees will be clearly explained in their Client Care Letter and Fee Agreement before you sign.

If you have any questions about fees at any stage of the process, please don't hesitate to ask us or your solicitor.

## How We Get Paid (Referral Fees)

Website Builder receives a referral fee from the solicitor when we successfully introduce a client. This means:

- The fee is paid by the solicitor to us (not by you)
- It does not come from your compensation
- It does not increase the solicitor's fees to you
- It is fully disclosed and FCA-compliant

This referral fee arrangement is standard practice and allows us to provide our assessment and matching service to you at no cost.

## Regulatory Information

:::company
:::

The solicitors we refer you to are also regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) and must comply with FCA regulations which cap success fees at 30% plus VAT for financial claims.
