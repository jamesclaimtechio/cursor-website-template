## Our Commitment

At My Claims Centre, we are committed to providing high-quality referral services to all our clients. However, we recognize that there may be occasions when you feel our service has not met your expectations.

We take all complaints seriously and will investigate them thoroughly and fairly. This page explains how to make a complaint about our referral service and what you can expect from our complaints process.

:::infobox[blue] Complaints About Your Solicitor
If your complaint is about the legal services provided by your solicitor (rather than our referral service), you should direct your complaint to them in the first instance. Solicitors have their own complaints procedures and are regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA).
