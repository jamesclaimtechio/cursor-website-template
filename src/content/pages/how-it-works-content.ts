Picture this: You're sitting at home, wondering if you're one of the millions affected by hidden car finance commission. You've heard about the scandal, but the claims process seems daunting—maybe even too complicated to bother with. Sound familiar?

Here's the truth: making a car finance claim doesn't have to be overwhelming. We've stripped away the complexity and built a process designed around one simple idea: getting you the compensation you deserve without the hassle.

## How Our Claims Process Actually Works

Let's walk through exactly what happens when you check your eligibility with us. No legal jargon, no hidden steps—just a clear explanation of how we help you claim what's yours.

### The Journey Starts With You (And a 2-Minute Form)

Think back to when you got your car on finance. Maybe it was 2015, maybe 2020. The dealer said "I'll sort the finance for you"—and you trusted them. That's where the problem started, because in most cases, they earned undisclosed commission by inflating your interest rate.

Here's where we come in.

**Our eligibility check** takes about 2 minutes. We'll ask you simple questions: When did you get your car? Who arranged the finance? What was the lender called? That's it. No documents needed yet, no commitment required.

:::keytakeaway Why This Matters
If you bought a car on finance between 2007 and 2024, and a dealer arranged it, you're likely eligible. The check is free because we want to help you understand if you have a claim—whether you proceed with us or not.
:::

**What happens behind the scenes:** Our team reviews your information against the eligibility criteria. We're looking for specific markers: finance arranged by a dealer (not directly from a bank), agreements during the DCA period, signs that hidden commission was likely charged.

Most people who fill out the form discover they ARE eligible. If you're not, we'll tell you straight away and explain why—no hard sell, no pressure.

### We Match You With a Specialist Solicitor (Within 48 Hours)

Let's say you're eligible (great news!). Here's what happens next.

We don't handle legal claims ourselves—we're not solicitors. Instead, we work with a network of FCA-regulated specialist solicitors who focus exclusively on car finance claims. Think of us as a matchmaker: we connect you with the legal expert best suited to your case.

**Within 24-48 hours**, you'll hear from one of our solicitor partners. They'll:

:::checklist
- Review your case details in more depth
- Explain what your claim involves
- Answer any questions you have
- Outline their no win, no fee terms
- Send you their formal Client Care Letter
:::

:::infobox[blue] Important: This Is Free
Our referral service costs you nothing. Zero. We receive a referral fee from the solicitor if you proceed, but this doesn't come from your compensation and doesn't increase their fees. Your solicitor's charges are separate (typically up to 30% + VAT on successful claims) and will be clearly explained.
:::

**Take your time deciding.** You're not locked into anything at this stage. Chat with the solicitor, ask questions, get comfortable. This is YOUR claim, and you should feel confident about who's handling it.

### You Sign Your Solicitor's Agreement (With a 14-Day Cooling-Off Period)

Ready to proceed? Your solicitor will send you a **Client Care Letter and Fee Agreement**. This is standard legal practice—it protects both you and them.

**What's in this agreement?**

Think of it as a contract that clearly spells out:

**The services they'll provide** - Your solicitor will handle everything from gathering documents to negotiating with lenders. They become your legal representative in this matter.

**Their fee structure** - Typically, solicitors charge a success fee of up to 30% plus VAT. This means if they recover £1,000 for you, they keep £300 + £60 VAT (£360 total), and you receive £640. If your claim fails, you pay nothing.

**Your rights and their obligations** - What you can expect from them, how they'll communicate with you, what happens if you want to cancel.

:::example Fee Breakdown: A Real Scenario
Let's say the lender agrees to pay you £1,200 in compensation.

**Lender pays:** £1,200.00  
**Solicitor's success fee (30%):** -£360.00  
**VAT on fee (20%):** -£72.00  
**You receive:** £768.00

You keep more than 60% of the compensation, and remember: if you'd lost the claim, you'd have paid nothing.
:::

**The 14-day cooling-off period is crucial.** After signing, you have two weeks to change your mind for any reason—no questions asked, no fees charged. This is legally required to protect consumers, so use it if you need to think things over.

### Your Solicitor Does the Heavy Lifting (You Just Wait for Updates)

This is where you get to sit back and let the professionals handle things. Here's what your solicitor does while you go about your life:

**Gathering evidence** - They'll request your finance agreement from the lender, track down commission records, and compile everything needed to build your case. You might need to provide some basic details (like confirming your address or signing authority letters), but they do the legwork.

**Contacting the lender** - Your solicitor sends a formal claim letter to the finance company. This isn't a casual request—it's a legal letter citing specific regulations and court rulings that support your case.

**Presenting your case** - They'll lay out exactly why you're entitled to compensation: the hidden commission arrangements, lack of disclosure, the financial impact on you. Everything backed by evidence.

**Negotiating on your behalf** - Lenders often push back initially or offer lowball settlements. Your solicitor knows this game. They'll negotiate to maximize your compensation based on what you're actually owed.

**Keeping you updated** - You'll receive regular progress updates. No need to chase them—they'll proactively tell you what's happening at each stage.

:::keytakeaway Timeline Expectations
**Simple cases:** 3-6 months from start to settlement  
**Complex cases:** 6-12 months (if lender disputes or appeals)  
**Ombudsman route:** Add 6-8 months (but often results in better compensation)

Your solicitor will give you realistic timelines based on your specific case and the lender involved.
:::

**What if the lender rejects your claim?** Don't panic—this happens. Your solicitor can escalate to the **Financial Ombudsman Service**, whose decisions are binding on lenders. Many initially rejected claims succeed at the Ombudsman stage.

### You Get Your Compensation (Clear, Transparent, Final)

Your claim succeeded! Here's how you actually receive your money.

**Step 1: Lender pays solicitor** - The finance company sends the compensation to your solicitor's client account (a protected account separate from their business funds).

**Step 2: Solicitor calculates deductions** - They'll prepare a clear breakdown showing:
- Total compensation awarded
- Their success fee (percentage agreed)
- VAT on the fee
- Any other agreed costs (like insurance premiums if applicable)
- **Net amount payable to you**

**Step 3: You receive a settlement statement** - This document shows exactly where every penny went. It's yours to keep for your records.

**Step 4: Money hits your account** - Your solicitor transfers your net compensation directly to your bank account. Usually within 5-10 business days of receiving payment from the lender.

:::highlight[green] Success Story (Anonymized)
One client we referred had a 2017 PCP agreement with Close Brothers. The dealer arranged the finance without mentioning commission. Our solicitor partner recovered **£1,340 in compensation**. After fees, the client received **£872**—money they never would've seen without making a claim.
:::

**That's it.** Claim complete. You've been compensated for the hidden commission you overpaid years ago.

## What Makes This Different From Claiming Yourself?

You might be wondering: "Can't I just do this myself and keep 100% of the compensation?"

Absolutely you can—and we'll be honest about this: **you have the right to make claims yourself for free.**

Here's the reality though:

:::proscons Claiming Yourself vs Using a Solicitor
pros:
- You keep 100% of any compensation
- No fees or success charges
- Complete control over the process
- Direct communication with lender
cons:
- You handle all correspondence and deadlines
- Lenders often push back harder on unrepresented claimants
- You need to understand FCA regulations and legal precedents
- Time-consuming (10-20 hours of work)
- Risk of undersettlement if you don't know what you're owed
- If rejected, you need to navigate Ombudsman process alone
:::

**Using a specialist solicitor means:**
- They know exactly what evidence to demand
- Lenders take legal representation more seriously
- You're more likely to get the full amount you're owed
- No time investment from you
- Expert handling of rejections or disputes
- You only pay if you win

Think of it like this: you could fix your own car (and save money), or you could hire a mechanic who does it daily. Both options work—it depends on your skills, time, and confidence.

## What If My Claim Is Unsuccessful?

Let's address the elephant in the room: **what happens if you lose?**

**With our solicitor partners:** You pay nothing. That's what "no win, no fee" means. No hidden charges, no "administration fees," no surprises. If your claim fails, the only thing you've lost is the time it took to fill out the initial form.

**Why might a claim fail?**

:::warning Not All Finance Agreements Qualify
Claims typically fail when:
- You arranged finance directly with a bank (no dealer involvement)
- The finance agreement clearly disclosed commission arrangements
- Your agreement falls outside the eligible period (2007-2024)
- Evidence shows commission was reasonable and disclosed
- Lender can prove they acted within regulations
:::

**Your solicitor will tell you upfront if your claim is weak.** Reputable solicitors won't take cases they don't believe will succeed—it's not worth their time either. So if they agree to represent you, it's because they genuinely believe you have a valid claim.

## How Long Does It Really Take?

We've mentioned timelines throughout, but let's be crystal clear about expectations.

**The honest answer:** Most claims take **3-6 months** for straightforward cases. Complex cases or those requiring Financial Ombudsman involvement can take **6-18 months**.

**What affects timing?**

**Lender responsiveness** - Some lenders process claims quickly; others drag their feet. Close Brothers, Black Horse, and Santander have different processing speeds.

**Quality of your evidence** - If you have your original finance agreement and clear records, things move faster. If documents need to be tracked down, it adds time.

**Complexity of your case** - Single finance agreement with clear hidden commission? Quick. Multiple agreements, disputes about disclosure, or affordability issues? Longer.

**Whether it goes to Ombudsman** - If your lender rejects your claim and you escalate to the Financial Ombudsman Service, add 6-8 months. But remember: Ombudsman decisions are binding, and often result in higher compensation.

:::keytakeaway Managing Expectations
**DON'T expect:** Money within weeks or even a month or two  
**DO expect:** Regular updates, professional handling, and fair compensation when the process completes

This isn't a quick cash grab—it's a legitimate legal claim that takes time to process properly. But the compensation is worth the wait.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How long does the eligibility check take?**

About 2 minutes to complete the form. We'll review it and get back to you within 24-48 hours with an answer.

**Do I need to contact the lender myself?**

No. Once you've signed your solicitor's agreement, they handle ALL communication with the lender. You don't need to speak to or email the finance company at all.

**What if I've already paid off the finance?**

That's fine! You can still claim. The fact that you've paid off the agreement doesn't affect your eligibility—you're claiming for compensation you overpaid during the term.

**What if I don't have my original paperwork?**

Not a problem. Your solicitor can request copies of your finance agreement from the lender. Lenders are legally required to keep these records for years.

**Can I cancel after I've started?**

Yes. You have a **14-day cooling-off period** after signing your solicitor's agreement. After that, you can still cancel, but termination fees may apply (clearly explained in your agreement).

**Do I pay My Claims Centre anything?**

No. Our service is completely free to you. We receive a referral fee from the solicitor if you proceed, but this doesn't come from your compensation and doesn't increase their fees.

**How much compensation will I get?**

We can't predict exact amounts—it depends on your specific circumstances. Industry data suggests average payouts around £700 per agreement, but your amount could be higher or lower based on the commission charged and your finance amount.

**What if I had multiple finance agreements?**

Even better—you can potentially claim on each eligible agreement. Your solicitor will assess all of them.
