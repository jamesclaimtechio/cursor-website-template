## Why Millions of UK Consumers Are Claiming Car Finance Compensation

Picture this: In 2015, you walked into a car dealership excited about your new car. The salesman was friendly, professional—made everything feel easy. When it came to finance, he said "leave it to me, I'll get you sorted." Twenty minutes later, you had approval, affordable monthly payments, and drove off happy.

What you didn't know: that dealer had just earned anywhere from £500 to £3,000+ in hidden commission—by inflating your interest rate. The higher your rate, the more they made. And nobody told you this was happening.

**This is the car finance claims scandal.** Between 2007 and 2024, an estimated 14 million UK consumers were affected by these hidden commission arrangements. Financial regulators have called them "unfair," the Supreme Court has examined them, and now compensation is being paid.

### What Actually Happened?

Here's the simple version of what went wrong:

**Dealers acted as "credit brokers"** - When they arranged your finance, they weren't doing you a favor. They were earning commission from lenders like Close Brothers, Black Horse, Santander, and dozens more.

**Commission was discretionary** - Instead of a flat fee, lenders used something called Discretionary Commission Arrangements (DCAs). The dealer could choose your interest rate from a range—say, 7% to 12%. Higher rate = higher commission.

**You were never told** - In most cases, consumers had no idea this arrangement existed. There might've been vague language in paperwork about "receiving fees," but nobody explained the dealer could inflate your rate to earn more money.

**It created a conflict of interest** - The dealer should've recommended the best rate for YOU. Instead, they had a financial incentive to recommend the highest rate they could justify. That's fundamentally unfair.

:::keytakeaway The Bottom Line
If you bought a car on finance between 2007 and 2024, and a dealer arranged that finance, you're likely eligible to claim compensation. Even if your payments seemed affordable at the time, you could've paid hundreds or thousands of pounds more than necessary—and you deserve that money back.

### This Isn't a "Too Good to Be True" Scheme

You might be skeptical. Claims companies get a bad rap (sometimes deservedly). So let's be clear about what this is:

**This is legitimate:** The Financial Conduct Authority has acknowledged the issue and launched a redress scheme starting May 2026. The Supreme Court has examined these arrangements and found them problematic. This isn't some made-up claim—it's based on actual regulations and court rulings.

**This affected millions:** The FCA estimates up to 14 million consumers were impacted. Car finance was everywhere between 2007-2024, and DCAs were industry standard. If you had dealer-arranged finance during this period, you're statistically very likely to have been affected.

**You have rights:** Under the Consumer Credit Act 1974, you're entitled to be treated fairly and given adequate information about commission arrangements. If that didn't happen, you can claim compensation—whether you use our service or claim yourself.

## How We Help You Claim (Without the Hassle)

Let's be honest: making a legal claim sounds intimidating. Solicitors, paperwork, lenders pushing back—it's enough to make you think "maybe it's not worth the hassle for £700."

But here's what we've done: **we've removed the hassle.**

### What We Actually Do

We're not solicitors ourselves. We don't handle legal claims. Instead, think of us as a matchmaker:

**You tell us about your finance** - 2-minute form with basic questions (when, where, who arranged it)

**We assess your eligibility** - Our team reviews your information and checks if you're likely eligible

**We introduce you to a specialist solicitor** - If eligible, we connect you with an FCA-regulated solicitor who focuses exclusively on car finance claims

**The solicitor handles everything** - From that point, your solicitor manages your claim while you go about your life

**You receive compensation** - If successful, compensation is paid directly to you (minus the solicitor's success fee)

:::infobox[blue] What This Costs You
**Our service:** Free. Zero. Nothing.  
**Solicitor fees (if you win):** Typically up to 30% + VAT  
**If your claim fails:** You pay nothing

We receive a referral fee from the solicitor, but this doesn't come from your compensation and doesn't increase their fees.
:::

### Why Not Just Claim Yourself?

Fair question. **You absolutely can claim yourself for free**—you have that right, and nobody should tell you otherwise.

Here's the reality though:

**DIY claiming means:**
- You handle all correspondence with lenders
- You need to understand FCA regulations and legal precedent
- Lenders often push back harder on unrepresented claimants
- You invest 10-20 hours of your time
- Risk of undersettlement if you don't know what you're owed

**Using a specialist solicitor means:**
- They know exactly what evidence to demand
- Lenders take legal representation seriously
- You're more likely to get full compensation
- No time investment from you
- Expert handling if lenders reject or dispute

It's like fixing your own car vs. hiring a mechanic. Both options work—it depends on your skills, time, and confidence. We're here if you want the expert handling approach.

### What Makes Us Different?

There are lots of companies in this space. Here's what makes us different:

**We're transparent about what we do** - We don't blur lines. We're a referral service, not solicitors. We connect you with the legal experts who handle your actual claim.

**We only work with specialists** - Our solicitor partners focus exclusively on car finance claims. They have proven track records with thousands of successful cases.

**No pressure, ever** - If you're not eligible, we tell you straight away. If you are eligible but decide not to proceed, that's completely fine. We're here to help, not pressure.

**Transparent service** - We're a referral service connecting you with specialist solicitors. Our service is free to you, and everything is explained clearly upfront.

## Could You Have a Claim? Quick Check

Let's figure out if you're likely eligible. Answer these questions in your head:

:::checklist Did you...
- Buy a car (or van/motorcycle) on finance between 2007-2024?
- Have a dealer or car salesman "sort the finance" for you?
- Use PCP, HP, conditional sale, or a dealer-arranged loan?
- Not receive clear explanation of dealer's commission arrangements?
:::

**If you answered YES to all of these**, you're very likely eligible to claim.

**If you answered YES to most of these** (but aren't sure about one or two), you should still check—we can often clarify the details.

**If you answered NO to the timeframe** (your finance was before 2007 or after 2024), you're probably not eligible for DCA claims, but might have other grounds (like affordability claims).

:::warning Don't Let Uncertainty Stop You
Many people think "I'm not sure if my situation qualifies" and never check. The eligibility assessment takes 2 minutes and costs nothing. Even if you're uncertain, it's worth finding out—you have nothing to lose and potentially hundreds or thousands to gain.
:::

### Next Steps

**Option 1: Check your eligibility now** - Fill out our 2-minute form and we'll tell you within 24-48 hours if you're eligible

**Option 2: Read more first** - Visit our [comprehensive guide](/car-finance-claims) to understand exactly how this works

**Option 3: Ask us questions** - Email info@myclaimscentre.co.uk with specific questions about your situation

**Whichever you choose, don't ignore this.** If you had dealer-arranged car finance between 2007-2024, the statistical likelihood is that you're owed compensation. The only question is whether you'll claim it.

## Real Claims, Real Compensation (Anonymized)

Let's look at some real cases handled by our solicitor partners. Names and details have been changed to protect privacy, but these are genuine examples:

:::example Sarah's 2017 Close Brothers PCP Claim
**Situation:** Sarah bought a used Audi A4 on PCP through a dealership in 2017. The dealer arranged Close Brothers finance at 10.9% APR. She had good credit and steady income—should've qualified for around 7-8% if she'd applied directly to a bank.

**What happened:** Her solicitor requested the finance agreement and commission records. Turns out the dealer earned £1,840 in commission by choosing 10.9% instead of 7.9%. That extra 3% meant Sarah paid £1,340 more in interest over 4 years than she needed to.

**Result:** £1,340 compensation awarded. After solicitor fees (30% + VAT), Sarah received £872. Money she never would've seen without claiming.
:::

:::example David's Multiple Agreements
**Situation:** David bought three cars between 2012 and 2019—all financed through dealerships with different lenders (Black Horse, Santander, and FirstRand). He never knew dealers earned higher commission for inflating rates.

**What happened:** His solicitor made three separate claims. Two lenders settled relatively quickly; the third initially rejected but was overturned at the Financial Ombudsman.

**Result:** Total compensation across three claims: £2,480. After fees, David received £1,612. He's now put that toward buying his next car outright—no more finance.
:::

:::example Emma's "Affordable" Monthly Payments
**Situation:** Emma's PCP seemed fine—£295/month for a VW Golf didn't feel excessive. She never questioned whether she was getting a good rate; the dealer said it was "competitive," so she believed him.

**What happened:** Her solicitor discovered that at a fair rate (based on her credit profile), she should've paid around £265/month. That £30 difference over 48 months was £1,440—but some went to depreciation, some to interest. The inflated interest portion: £890.

**Result:** £890 compensation. After fees, Emma received £578. She was initially skeptical it was worth claiming, but now she tells everyone to check their eligibility.
:::

**Notice a pattern?** None of these people thought they'd been mis-sold until they checked. Their payments seemed reasonable at the time. But "reasonable" and "fair" aren't the same thing—and that's what these claims are about.
